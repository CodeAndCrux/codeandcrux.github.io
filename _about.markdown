title: What Gets Me Out of Bed in the Morning

I played guitar for my grandfather when he was on his deathbed. I wasn't any good, but he was stoned on morphine. He loved the music. After I played, he told me something about women. Then he said, "Take it all, kid. Take it all."

I will never know exactly what he meant by that, but I have an idea. He passed his heart to me. He passed it through genetics. He passed it through my father. He passed it through his actions. He passed it through the meals and conversations we shared. He passed it through neighbors and friends.

The week of his funeral, I was at the grocery store with my parents in my father's hometown. We ran into a family friend. As a sort of eulogy, the man told us something I never noticed about my grandfather. He pointed out that my grandfather always said, "that's life." He said it when something good happened. He said it when something bad happened. He said it when he got old.

"That's life." It has a ring of stoicism to it, but I don't think my grandfather was merely stoic. He liked to laugh. He would say silly things like "Donut Enter" when there was a "Do Not Enter" sign. And from time to time he would indulge me with a story from his childhood, like how he used to shoot firecrackers out of a copper pipe.

He liked to tell people off when they did something he didn't like too. He was always giving his neighbors a hard time about something. Their kids' basketball smashed the cantelope vines in his garden. Their garage was too damn full of garbage.

He was more than stoic. He built furniture. He carved wooden birds. He built a cabin with his own hands. To have this man within me, bestowed with many of his traits, is an honor.

When I was a child, I learned that my mother had never been stung by a bee. "But don't you want to know what it feels like?" I asked with all sincerity. Without hesitation, she said, "no."

I thought that it must be terrible to live a whole life and never know what it feels like to be stung by a bee. It hurts, and then the pain amplifies. It is peculiar. I couldnâ€™t understand why someone would want never to know such a thing. It is not pleasurable to be stung by a bee, but it is a part of life.

That is quite my outlook. I want to experience all of life, not just the pleasures. I want to feel it all. I want to know it. I want to understand it. That is why I create: to remember what I know about life, to feel what I know about life, to organize what I know about life, to share what I know about life.

Give me life! Give me beautiful life! And then give me death! Give me beautiful death! Whatever my fate, I will take it.

But I want more than that too. I want more than to be a bystander, a victim, a fool. I want to be a hero. I want to struggle and overcome. I want to matter.

That is what gets me out of bed in the morning. I want to strive for the absolute best, the virtuous, and I will take the wild adventures, the painful injuries, the triumphant victories, and the shocking betrayals, that come with it.

As an ointment for the pain, we have the beautiful, and as a touchstone for the beautiful, we have pain. For the darkness, we have the light, and for the light, we have the darkness. For life, we have death, and for death we have hope in eternal life. I don't just want some of it. I want it all.

How disappointing the endless pleasure of the hedonist. How hollow the life without tears and sweat and blood and bee stings and laughter and fear and romance and undying love. How blind to joy the life without despair. How unappreciative of sweetness the tongue that never tasted anything else.

I have to imagine my grandfather was referring to life itself as he lay there looking at death. "Take it all, kid. Take it all." Life is to be lived awake not asleep. Lord, whatever you give me, give me. I will take it all.
