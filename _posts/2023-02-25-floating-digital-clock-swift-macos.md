I made a very basic digital clock app for MacOS written in the Swift programming language.

I created it because I like keeping my menu bar hidden, but I want to see the time without moving my mouse cursor to the top of the screen. The special thing about this clock app is that it stays on top of all the other apps so it is always visible no matter what app is in use.

I call it **Top Clock**.
