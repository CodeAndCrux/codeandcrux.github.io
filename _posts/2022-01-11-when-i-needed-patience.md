One Saturday afternoon, I went to confession. Among other things, I confessed that I was harboring self-pity. The priest asked why, and I told him it was because I was single and felt lonely. Then he asked, “what does God want you to do about it?”

“I don’t know,” I said.

“Well, ask him.” Father said.

After confession, I kneeled in front of a St Joseph statue at the back of the church, and did my penance. Then, I went to a pew and waited for Saturday afternoon mass to begin. I kneeled down and I asked God what he wanted me to do about my predicament.

Sometimes God answers slowly, like a sunrise. But this time, he answered right away. In an epiphany, the word “patience” came to me along with an overwhelming sense of relief. I even laughed a little bit. Patience seems to imply that love will come to me eventually, and that is comforting.

God’s answer surprised me. I thought I was doing just fine as far as patience goes. I have been single for, well, a long time; longer than most people. But I guess that doesn’t automatically mean I have patience. The more I mulled over the answer, the more it made sense.

Later that evening, I mowed my lawn. In doing so, I found out that I have an attractive neighbor. She is also the mother of a one-or-two-year-old girl. She also has a husband.

Over the next couple days, my thoughts were plagued with envy. As one of the seven deadly sins, envy is no joke. I was envious of my neighbor, the husband, because he had a beautiful wife and child.

I decided to correct the sin, but I had no idea how to stop feeling envious. I knew about the seven deadly sins. I also knew of the seven lively virtues which correspond to, and help one fight against, the seven deadly sins.

I searched the web. It turns out, the virtue that combats envy is patience. “God really does know what I need,” I thought. I didn’t know I needed patience, yet somehow the answer “patience” came to me.

The next time I went to confession, I was eager to know my penance. It was the second Saturday in December. The Gospel reading for that Sunday was Luke 3:10–18. In the reading, the crowds ask John the Baptist, “what should we do?”

In the spirit of the Sunday reading, the priest gave me one of the heftier penances I have ever been given. He told me to ask God what I should do each day, and then spend six to ten minutes listening for his answer, and do this until January 1st. “By then,” he said, “you should have a good idea of what God wants you to do.”

I took that penance seriously. I wanted to know what I should do, and who better to tell me than God himself? So this was my mantra each day: “God, the Father, what should I do? Jesus Christ, the son and redeemer, what should I do? Holy Spirit, what should I do? Saint John the Baptist, what should I do?” I didn’t get an answer right away this time, but when I needed it, it came.

The Wednesday following my confession, I went to adoration. I was kneeling in front of Jesus Christ, and I kept asking, “what should I do?” But I still wasn’t getting an answer. I got more specific about it — “should I write a novel? should I go skiing? should I serve at a soup kitchen? should I make computer programming videos?” Still no answer.

I started to feel anxious. In fact, I think I was on the verge of a panic attack. I was thinking crazy stuff like, “maybe God isn’t giving me an answer because I am about to die, so he doesn’t want me to do anything.”

Then, I decided to pray the Rosary. Seconds after I finished, I had another epiphany. This time, the word “trust” came to me, clear as day. Along with it came that sense of peace and relief that I felt when I had the epiphany of “patience.”

Once again, God’s answer was not what I expected. I was hoping Jesus would step out of the monstrance and say, “write a novel,” or something specific like that. Instead, his answer was, “trust.” Really, though, I was just glad he gave me an answer.

A week or two later, something happened that gave me a better understanding of God’s answers. I was at my parents’ house for Christmas. I told them about my “patience” epiphany and said, “but I searched around online and couldn’t find any practical steps you can do to build up patience; not like with courage where you can do things that scare you to get better at it.” My dad said, “I have a book that might help you with that.”

The book is called Patience and Humility. It was written long ago by William Ullathorne.

Needless to say, I dove right into the book. I skipped the humility part and went to the patience part, though I plan to circle back around to the humility part someday. I could certainly use some help with that virtue as well. Plus, Ullathorne says, “so intimate is the connection between patience and humility, that neither of those virtues can make much progress without the other.”

In the patience part, William Ullathorne says something that makes a lot of sense:
“The first thing to understand is that patience is an immediate exercise of the will, which is the spring of all free and moral actions. It must not, therefore, be confounded with the sentiments, sensibilities, or feelings, because it is a pure act of the will.”

Basically, he’s saying that patience is something we choose. It is not like a feeling that comes to us because we saw something sad like a hungry child, or because we saw something pleasant like a puppy. Much like push-ups are an exercise of the body, patience is an exercise of the will. It may not be easy, but it is a choice.

William Ullathorne goes on to say, “When the will rests on God, looks to God, and draws strength from God, the patience which resists all evils and disorders, gives us the possession of ourselves, and keeps the soul in peace is generated.”
And then he quotes Psalm 62:5. In the Douay-Rheims Bible, the verse goes, “But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: for from him is my patience.”

I think William Ullathorne and the Psalmist are saying that we get patience by trusting God. If that’s the case, then it is interesting that God first told me to have patience. Then, he told me how to be patient; by trusting him.

A few paragraphs later, William Ullathorne said something that alarmed me: “sadness is the most selfish of all selfish things.”

What about Jesus’s agony in the Garden of Gethsemane? What about the seven sorrows of the Blessed Mother? What about Job?

I think I’ll take a deeper dive into William Ullathorne’s statement about sadness some other time. Anyway, that statement prompted me to look “sadness” up in the index of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. It lead me to paragraph 2553 which lead me to paragraph 2554 which helps confirm that my epiphany of the word “trust” really was God telling me how to be patient.

Paragraph 2553 says, “Envy is sadness at the sight of another’s goods and the immoderate desire to have them for oneself. It is a capital sin.”

Paragraph 2554 says, “The baptized person combats envy through good-will, humility, and abandonment to the providence of God.”

Remember earlier, I found out that patience is the virtue that combats envy? Now, here, the Catechism is saying good-will, humility, and abandonment to the providence of God, combat envy. Between that and William Ullathorne’s statement about generating patience, it makes sense that good-will, humility, and abandonment to the providence of God, are great ways to become more patient. God really was telling me how to be patient when he gave me the epiphany of “trust.”

He didn’t stop there though. In the weeks that I was completing my penance, asking God what I should do, I had two more epiphanies. One came shortly after I said goodbye to my boss, who was retiring.

I went to his office at the end of the day, shook his hand, chatted for a couple minutes, and then left. But I felt a little hole in my heart afterward. I felt that I wasn’t patient enough with the moment. I was anxious because he was my boss. I was anxious because saying goodbye is a difficult and sentimental thing. I let that anxiety stop me from being fully present with my boss in that moment. I let it hurry me away.

That experience lead to my third epiphany, “slow down when you are spending time with people.”

Our culture idolizes productivity, efficiency, and speed, but at what cost? I didn’t want to take up too much of my boss’s time, but at what cost? I wanted to hurry home after a busy work day, but at what cost? I hurry through my work, but at what cost? I hurry through my dinner, but at what cost? I hurry through my prayers, but at what cost? What good comes from hurrying through life?

That epiphany, “slow down,” goes right along with patience. Patience and slowing down are two different things. We can hurry without sacrificing patience, and we can slow down, but still be impatient. However, it is generally easier to be patient when we realize that we don’t need to operate at maximum speed and efficiency. So when God gave me the epiphany to “slow down,” it was a relief. It was like he was saying, “there’s no rush.” It helped me to be more patient.

He wasn’t done helping me yet, though. My final epiphany came in a half-dream. At this point, I had been thinking and praying for a couple weeks, asking God what I should do, and I was only a couple days from finishing my penance. I knew God wanted me to be patient, to trust Him, and to slow down, but I was still unsure how I should manifest that in my daily actions. Should I write? Should I make YouTube videos? Should I go live with homeless people in Chicago? Should I do nothing? After lots of contemplation and a couple other strange coincidences, I felt that writing and wood carving fit the bill.

I was sitting up in bed, and I started my penance prayer; “God, what should I do?” About halfway through my meditation, I drifted off into a dream. It was one of those dreams where you’re not quite asleep, but you’re definitely dreaming.

I was with a woman, and I felt God’s presence there as well, and I told them that I felt my task was to write and whittle. Then, just as I was waking out of this half-dream, the woman, myself, and God, all at once, with the same voice, said “I love you.”

I felt like a teenager in love, and at the same time I felt loved by the most beautiful being in existence. And now, this beautiful being gave me the final piece to his answer.

Patience, trust, slow down, I love you. Those were God’s answers to me. They were not what I expected, but I must admit they were the perfect answers. They fit particularly well into my current life situation, but they may be useful to you too. Be patient. Do that by trusting in God and allowing yourself to slow down. And know that God loves you.

Perhaps the greatest lesson in all of this is not how to be patient. Perhaps the greatest lesson is to pray. When you are struggling with something, ask God what he wants you to do about it. Then, listen patiently for his answer.

May we always be like King David, consulting with God in everything we do.
May we always be like Joseph, understanding when God speaks to us.
May we always be like the Blessed Mother, gracefully accepting his will.
May we always be like Jesus Christ, carrying our crosses with love in our hearts.
May we always be like Saint Monica, persevering in good-will, humility, and abandonment to the providence of God.
Amen.
