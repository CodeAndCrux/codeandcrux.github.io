With luck, I’ll see October’s spell on trees<br>
a hundred times before eternal sleep,<br>
but beauty now arrests my heart with peace<br>
when, each October, life sings harmony.

A hundred times to witness fall’s great peak<br>
when here an oak tree turns to orange leaf,<br>
and overnight a maple turns bright red,<br>
and on the hill an elm is still half green,

when yesterday the air was full of heat,<br>
and then this morning came with cool relief,<br>
and now a rain blows past and then retreats<br>
and lays upon the leaves a glossy sheet,

and then a soft scent rises, kind of sweet,<br>
but not sweet like Halloween candy,<br>
sweet like memories of past Octobers,<br>
sweet like a child who kisses on the cheek.

Then finally, as one, these beauties meet;<br>
a moment when I see the heavens peak,<br>
a moment when I hear the heavens speak,<br>
a moment that arrests my heart with peace.

With luck, before eternal sleep, I’ll see<br>
a mere one hundred beautiful as these,<br>
and yet their might and quickness to retreat<br>
so drive my heart to cherish such a feat.
