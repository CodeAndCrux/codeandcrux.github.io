## Learn From My Struggles
Some people are insane for no apparent reason. But for most of us, there are reasons for our insanity. Uncovering those reasons and fixing the problems can bring us back to sanity. I am writing of my struggles with mental health, and the lessons I have learned, because I want to help anyone who will listen. I shied away from writing this for many years, partly because I still had too many struggles and too much to learn, and partly because I did not have the courage to expose myself in this way.

Mental health is a moving target. As we find solutions and improve, we grow accustomed to our new mental state. Our mental health baseline changes. For example, instead of feeling depressed all the time, I might only feel depressed a couple times a week. That is a relief, but as I get used to that, my baseline changes. Instead of being happy and relieved that I only feel depressed a couple times a week, feeling depressed a couple times a week becomes my normal, and then I must seek greater relief from my depression to improve my baseline. After some troubleshooting, I might solve another problem that helps me to only feel depressed once or twice a month. Once again, I am relieved. After a while, depression once or twice a month becomes my baseline. Once again, I am driven to improve.

This is my story to now. I believe my baseline level of happiness, of mental health, is far better than that of the average person. I believe I am in such a position that I can offer some degree of help to almost anyone experiencing mental health struggles.

Alas, not everyone wants help, so I am publishing this writing on my website so it is available to those who want it, and can be ignored by those who don’t want help. That said, if you want more help or have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I am not a doctor or a psychologist, but I have spent many years studying and personally experimenting in the fields of nutrition, physiology, theology, philosophy, and psychology. I will not claim to be an expert in any of them, but I believe that gives me a unique perspective that experts in those fields lack. Because of my lack of expertise, I am able to see the human in a more holistic way. A psychologist, to be an expert in psychology, must spend all of his time studying psychology, which often overlooks topics like nutrition’s role in mental health or religion’s role in anxiety disorders.

I am not an expert. I am a human being who has spent, very intentionally, the past ten years of his life seeking true health and happiness. While many experts were seeking academic merit, career advancement, or publishing opportunities, I was seeking true health and happiness, and I was documenting my journey. That is my qualification. Maybe that counts for something, maybe it does not. Either way, I am going to share my story. I hope it helps.

As much as I would like to explain why I believe I experienced these struggles, it would not aid in getting to the point of this particular piece of writing which is to explain my mental health trials and resolutions so that anyone reading can apply my experiences and the things I have learned to their own life.

I think, ultimately, that this writing is my way of giving meaning to my struggles. As Nietsche said, "To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. He who has a why to live can bear almost any how." (CITE) Or as Viktor Frankl put it, "In some ways, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning." (Man's Search for Meaning)

That's where we should all start. We should find meaning in our struggles. Just as a pain pill might not completely cure a migrain but takes the edge off enough that we can bear it, finding (and remembering) the meaning of our struggles can take the edge off enough that we can bear them.

## Find the Meaning of Your Struggles

I found meaning in my mental struggles when I was a sophomore in high school. I had been writing songs for a couple years, but they were all just funny songs I wrote to amuse my friends. They were songs about Chapstick and pancakes and filthy things that boys talk about. I had also been a big fan of music for a couple years, but I didn't pay much attention to the lyrics. I listened to heavy metal and political punk rock. I listened to music that felt good to skateboard to.

Then, as a sophomore, my friend showed me Dude Ranch by Blink-182. It was that same kind of punk rock that complemented skateboarding, but the lyrics seemed to come from my own heart. They were about the exact same things I was struggling with - girls, love, parents. At the same time, they were funny. That album rocked my world. It helped me realize I wasn't alone. And it opened the door to the world of pop punk.

In that same period of time, I came across Simple Plan. Their songs made me feel like someone understood me. And then I found out another friend listened to Simple Plan. We talked about it, and he had the same experience as I did. He felt better when he listened to this music.

It was then that I decided that I would be a punk rock musician. That would be my dream. That would be my life. I wanted to help people the same way that Simple Plan, Blink-182, and so many others had helped me. I started writing songs about everything I was feeling.

Then, something amazing happened. Anytime I faced a new struggle - with a girl, with school, with my parents, with my job - it didn't hurt so much. Instead of looking like a monster, it just looked like fuel for my songwriting. I didn't care so much what struggles I might have to face, and I was able to let go of old struggles that haunted me.

When songwriting was my life's purpose, I thrived. I still had struggles, but they weren't threats. I wrote songs about suicide, the emotional pain of break-ups, and even stomach problems. I certainly still had struggles, but my struggles had meaning. My struggles were going to enable me to help others.

When I experienced my first panic attack, I wrote a poem about it. When I couldn't stand the loneliness I felt during my sophomore year of college, I wrote a song about it. When my grandfather died, I wrote a song about it.

#### The Lesson
THIS NEEDS TO BE ME TALKING ABOUT ME, NOT ME PREACHING TO THE READING
- Gave up dream of being a songwriter, and moved back to PA from CA
If you're having trouble finding the meaning of your own struggles, spend some time looking at the works of mercy and the seven capital virtues. Both have been documented and passed down by the Catholic Church, but they can be used by anybody, Catholic or not. If you can put your struggle toward one or more of the works of mercy or capital virtues, you will find great strength.

The meaning of my struggles could have been simply to have something to write songs about, but it was when I realized that I could help others through my songs that I really found strength. The works of mercy and cardinal virtues are the highest goods that human beings can attain. If your struggles can be put toward any of them, then you have found a powerful force.

### The Corporal Works of Mercy (CITE Wikipedia)
To feed the hungry.
To give water to the thirsty.
To clothe the naked.
To shelter the homeless.
To visit the sick.
To visit the imprisoned, or ransom the captive.
To bury the dead.

### The Spiritual Works of Mercy (CITE Wikipedia)
To instruct the ignorant.
To counsel the doubtful.
To admonish the sinners.
To bear patiently those who wrong us.
To forgive offenses.
To comfort the afflicted.
To pray for the living and the dead.

### The Capital Virtues
Chastity
Temperance
Charity
Diligence
Kindness
Patience
Humility

Unfortunately, even with these beautiful tools passed down to us, finding meaning can be difficult or even impossible. Sometimes the meaning is a mystery to us. We are only human. In that case, maybe finding the meaning of your struggles is the meaning of your struggles. Maybe they are there so that you can find the meaning in them. Maybe your purpose should be to search to find the meaning. If you can find the meaning in a struggle, then you will have something valuable to share with others who are facing the same struggle.

If you can't find meaning, don't despair. There is more work to be done. There is still relief to be found. You may not understand the meaning of your mental health struggles, but there are other ways to alleviate the pain. Even if you do understand the meaning, you probably still want some relief.

As my story continues, greater struggles will come, but I will also find relief by focusing on doing the best I can with and for my body, mind, and soul.

## Stop Poisoning Yourself

I experienced my first panic attack when I was a sophomore in college. I remember exactly where I was. I was pulling into the parking lot of a Barnes and Noble book store. I had just finished eating Taco Bell and was slurping the last drops of a large Mountain Dew. I felt certain that I was going to die very soon, that impending death was upon me. I didn't know it was a panic attack. I just stayed the course. I got out of my car and walked into Barnes and Noble. I went to the poetry section and started leafing through some books. After a few minutes, the panic subsided.

When I got back to my apartment, I looked up the symptoms of a panic attack and found they matched what I experienced. I immediately wrote down what I had felt.

I don't recall having another panic attack like that until I was finished with my undergraduate studies.

I was working my first "real world" job. I was a marketing assistant at a property owners' association. During the holiday season, I worked a shopping mall Santa gig. I took pictures of kids sitting on Santa's lap and sold them to their parents. One day, I was scheduled to work in the evening. I started getting a migraine earlier in the day, so I took some Excedrin (migraine medicine) and drank a cup of coffee. I haven't touched any migraine medicine in years, so I am not sure what is in it now, but back then it contained the same amount of caffeine as a cup or two of coffee. That meant I consumed two or three coffees worth of caffeine in the span of about twenty minutes. And I was not a regular coffee drinker. In fact, I am very sensitive to caffeine. People have described to me what it is like to be high on cocaine. It sounds exactly the same as I feel when I drink a cup of coffee.

I thought nothing of the caffeine I had consumed. I was just glad to avoid the migraine. I went to the shopping mall for my shift.

It was close to the end of the holiday season. One of the Santas allegedly said some inappropriate stuff to a high school girl. The girls parents rightfully reported the Santa. Santa went rogue.

Actually, I'm not sure if Santa is guilty of this next part, I just wanted to write "Santa went rogue." He was a likely suspect though.

The owner of the whole "Pictures with Santa" operation fired the Santa the day before. When I arrived for my shift, one of my duties was to count the cash in our safe and go to the bank to get enough one and five dollar bills to make change for customers that evening. This day, I got to the mall and the safe was gone.

I looked all over our little storage closet. It was nowhere to be found. Panic struck. I thought I was going to die right there. I couldn't breathe. My vision was blurry. I was dizzy.

I pulled myself together enough to call my boss. My voice rattled as I explained that the safe was gone.

I don't remember how I ended up getting enough money for the night. I only remember that I had to walk to a bank on the other side of the shopping mall. I panicked about having to talk to the bank teller. I panicked about having to work the rest of my shift with a panic attack. I panicked about my entire life.

By the time I got to the bank and spoke to the teller, the panic attack had diminished. When I got back to our storage closet, I felt much better.

After that experience, I realized that caffeine was a trigger for me. My first panic attack happened after I drank a large Mountain Dew. My second happened after consuming a few coffees worth of caffeine.

When I realized that caffeine could make me anxious, I started to notice that other substances, like alcohol and cannabis, also brought on symptoms of anxiety.

#### The Lesson

In my experience, intoxicating substances are the biggest culprits, but over-the-counter drugs, hygiene products like soap or lotion, and certain foods can trigger symptoms of anxiety and depression.

I feel best when I do not consume drugs (including caffeine and over-the-counter medications) or alcohol. The last time I cut out caffeine, I was addicted to it, so I had some withdrawal symptoms, but after those passed I felt much better. I believe I am stronger for not relying on external substances, and I certainly feel better.

## Breathe Heavy and Break a Sweat

My sophomore year of college, I had become very lonely. I barely went out. I lost a lot of social sense that year.

My junior year was a little better. I moved into an apartment with an old friend from high school and two of his friends. I had a roommate, so I was at least forced to see another human being every day.

That year was the next time I faced abnormal anxiety (I consider it normal to be anxious before a class speech or a big test). One of the guys I lived with had gone to high school with me. I didn't know him when we were in high school, but a friend of mine did. My friend once told me about some mean things my apartment-mate had said about me in high school. I can't remember what they were now, but it was enough to make me not like the guy.

At the same time, my other friend from high school really liked him, and the guy was nice to me on the rare occasion that we actually spoke. Also, he seemed important. He was quick-witted and popular. I wanted him to like me.

A couple months into our first semester of living together, we had only spoken once and it was together with our other two apartment mates. One day, I saw that he was in his room, and I thought of something funny to say to him. I stepped into his doorway and said whatever it was, and he said, "what?" I said it again, but as I was saying it the second time, my head filled with such panic that I started to black out. If you've ever been on a roller coaster that goes so fast that you start to lose your peripheral vision, then you know what I mean when I say I started to black out. I wasn't on a roller coaster though, I was just standing in a doorway trying to say something funny to a guy I lived with.

I had the same experience in one other social interaction. Both times it was awful. Afterward, I hated myself. I had no idea how to control it or how to stop it or how to change. I just wanted to be normal.

I finally found some relief after I graduated college and was working at my first real job. I worked in the marketing department of a property owners' association. My boss would play the pop music station all day long. I hated it. But one day the DJ shared a little blurb about a new study. Researchers found that exercising to the point of sweating three times per week was as effective as taking anti-depressant medication.

You won't hear that kind of news in today's mainstream media because the pharmaceutical companies pay the media companies insane amounts of money. Fortunely, the mainstream media wasn't in big pharma's back pocket back then.

At the time, I hated my job, but other than that I wasn't particularly depressed. Nonetheless, I figured the exercise might make me feel better, so I started running a few times per week. I found it was a great way to separate the work day from the evening. It helped me shake everything off.

When I couldn't stand my marketing job anymore, and I had finally made concrete plans to become a musician, I moved to California.

I lived with my grandparents in Anaheim. I found a drummer to start a band with. He helped me get a job at a music studio. Things were pretty good, but I was anxious as Hell. I would wake up wondering if the day was going to be a scary one or not.

One time, I was talking to my new boss. We were in the main studio room. It had a big stage and lots of red and black and lust. He was explaining something to me when his phone started ringing. His ring tone sounded exactly like mine, but my ring tone was one that I had recorded myself with my ukulele. My mind started racing. I wondered how he could have possibly gotten my ring tone. The only explanation I could draw was that he was the devil. The lusty red and black surroundings and his black leather pants probably didn't help.

After a minute I realized that he didn't have my ring tone. He just had a common iPhone ring tone that I used to have before I recorded my own. He ended up being a great boss. He treated me well.

Among the anxious days, I also experienced some depressed days. Those days led me to start running again. After a couple runs, I realized that running was a potent antidote to my anxiety. I felt like a new man. I found the cure I was looking for. It was amazing, and it stayed that way. Actually, I haven't had a black-out panic attack since. I did have one other panic attack, and my social anxiety still loomed over me. I will write more about both of those later. My days fogged with a general feeling of anxiety, anxiety for no apparent reason, were over.

I still run. Just the other day I ran a 5K in 18 minutes and 22 seconds (flex). I have found that I can get by with running two miles twice a week. Any less than that and I get unnecessarily anxious or I get headaches and body aches.

Side note: I contracted Lyme's disease when I was twelve or thirteen. Body aches have been a normal part of my life ever since. Along with relieving my anxiety, running also drastically reduces the aches. Paired with a healthy diet, I now live a life that is almost entirely devoid of headaches and body aches.

#### The Lesson
Regular exercise has helped me immensely. It has especially helped with anxiety, but also with depression. When I exercise, I make sure I push hard enough that I start breathing heavily and sweating. It is hard at first. I often did not feel motivated, but I made myself start and soon the motivation came. After a while, it became habit.

Now, and for the past couple years, I have come to a point in my life where doing the work is a source of joy in itself. I am happy to do difficult things that are good for my body, mind, and soul.

I am at that point in my life now, but in this little memoir I am writing I was still living in California. I had more struggles to come. I had more lessons to learn.

## Fix Your Dinner
By now, you have read that I gave up my dream of being a songwriter. I moved back to Pennsylvania. I worked and went to grad school. I got a master's degree in Information Systems and a job at a tech startup. I was very busy, but kept a level head. I really believe my regular exercise habits played a huge role in that.

When I got my tech job, I moved into my own apartment. Suddenly, I had the freedom to choose whatever groceries, whatever breakfasts, lunches, and dinners I wanted. I knew I had to start eating healthy foods.

Ever since I had contracted Lyme's disease, I suffered from acid reflux and colitis. As a result, I had taken antacid medications regularly since I was about thirteen years old. My dad and a doctor had encouraged me to change my diet and see if I could get off of the medication. Now that I could choose what I ate, I was able to take steps toward that goal.

I researched and experimented and tweaked for years. At first, my diet didn't seem to affect my mental health. It did wonders for my acid reflux, but I didn't feel any different mentally. As time when on, though, I started noticing that I could go long periods of time without eating and not get hangry.

There were also times, especially around the holidays, when I did not stick to a healthy diet. During those times, I would notice that my mental health also suffered.

I found that sugar makes me neurotic. When I overdo sugar, I never know what I am going to get. It might be depression. It might be anxiety. It might be anger. I completely understand why people call it a drug. The stuff is nasty. My sister and some of my friends have had similar experiences with sugar. And they all have had this similar experience: we don't notice that sugar makes us neurotic until we give it up for a while and then eat some. Then we notice how terrible it makes us feel.

The stuff really is toxic.

The same goes for highly processed oils. When I have bad oils, my brain gets foggy, my nose gets stuffy, the acid reflux comes raging back, and I get depressed. I have no problems with cold-pressed olive oil. I have no problems with animal fats (I love duck fat and cook with it all the time). I have no problems with high quality ghee. But coconut oil, rape seed oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, and all the other highly processed vegetable oils wreck me.

Even science has produced extraordinary amounts of high quality evidence that sugars and oils are unhealthy. Beyond that, things get a little harder to figure out. One of the big limitations of science is that it sees humans as a group, a species, instead of as individuals. But what is healthy for one person might be deadly for another (e.g. peanuts, shellfish, and wheat). To complicate matters further, a person might be require a different diet at different stages in his or her life, or even different weeks in a month.

That said, it is absolutely possible to find a beneficial diet. It took me several years, but I am at a point where I am always satisfied by what I eat and never experience negative side effects. That could change as my body ages, but I now have a good baseline to work with.

Finding the best eating regimen for my body was quite a journey. I won't go into too much detail, but I will give a quick timeline.

Because I already knew that eating too much sugar gave me migraines, I started with a ketogenic diet. Then, I started including more paleo-friendly carbohydrates like sweet potatoes and bananas. After about a year of that, I took quite a turn. My dad had a heart attack. He survived, but it scared me. I started looking through the literature on heart health. What I found convinced me to switch to a vegan, whole-food, plant-based diet. I ate nothing that was processed before it landed on a store shelf, and no fish or animal products. I managed that diet for about two years.

After experiencing some strange symptoms, including anxiety, I went back to the literature. I came across a book I had read way back when I first started on a ketogenic diet. The book is called *Nourishing Traditions* by Sally Fallon. It is one of my favorite books on food/diet. While reading it, I started thinking that my anxiety, and a couple other symptoms, stemmed from a lack of animal fats in my diet.

That brings us to the eating regimen I have been following for the past couple of years now. It is basically the Mediterranean diet. But the Mediterranean Diet that has been popularized in America isn't quite the same as the traditional Mediterranean diet.

The popular Mediterranean Diet emphasizes lean cuts of meat, wine, and nuts, among other foods and food groups. The traditional Mediterranean diet included plenty of fatty meats because there wasn't enough wealth to let food go to waste. It also included healthier and less alcoholic wines because wine was not preserved with sulfites, it was not pasteurized (so it contained lots of natural probiotics and enzymes), and it was mostly mixed with water as a means of making the water safer to drink. The traditional Mediterannean diet also contained fewer nuts because our ancestors couldn't just go to the store and buy a bunch of already shelled nuts. If they wanted nuts, they either had to pay a high price for someone to shell them, or they had to do it themselves. If you've ever shelled nuts, you know it slows you down. It might take fifteen minutes just to shell a handful of almonds.

The traditional Mediterranean diet was also very seasonal because they didn't have refrigerators. And don't even get me started on the differences in the produce. Let me just say that tomatoes from a farm or garden taste like an entirely different food compared to tomatoes from a modern grocery store. It's abominable.

#### The Lesson

Oh, I could go on and on about food. Alas, this writing is about mental health. Ultimately, I try to eat the way our ancestors ate. This naturally cuts out junk foods, sugars, and highly processed crap because our ancestors simply did not have that stuff.

If you're interested in learning more about ancestral diets, I highly recommend reading *Nourishing Traditions* by Sally Fallon and/or *Eat Like a Human* by Dr. Bill Schindler. Both of them are fascinating.

As you can probably tell, I really enjoy nutrition and healthy eating. I also enjoy food that tastes really good and satisfies me. Junk food might taste good some of the time, but a donut can't satisfy me like a big bowl of oatmeal with blueberries and a little soy milk. And, to be honest, I've been disappointed with every single one the five-or-so donuts that I have eaten over the past few years. I quit bothering with them. There are healthier foods that also taste better and offer greater satisfaction.

I am at a point now where eating healthy, like exercising, has become a joy. I know it won't make me feel crappy. I know it will give me energy to get out in the world and do some work. I know it is good for my mental health.

I also started to enjoy cooking and now I find it is a great source of joy, and a good way to serve others. Even when I am only cooking for myself, I believe I am serving others. I am keeping my body and mind healthy so I have greater strength to serve, and I am getting better at cooking so that when I do cook for others, I can cook something delicious!

#### What a Day of Eating Looks Like For Me
When I'm hungry, sometime between 8:00am and 10:00am, I pan-fry two to four eggs and heat up some greens (kale, spinach, collards, etc) that I cooked in a pressure cooker. I top it off with some salt, maybe some pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. I wash that down with a little kombucha, but not too much because it contains caffeine.

Then, I make some oatmeal. I usually cook it with ginger, allspice, and cinnamon. Then I add some frozen berries and a little soy milk.

For lunch, I usually pan-fry sourdough starter (fermented from whole wheat flour) in duck fat. I sprinkle ground turmeric and salt on the sourdough pancake as it's cooking. After it's done, I drizzle olive oil on top. I dip the pancake in a very large helping of salsa (that doesn't have sugar or anything unnatural in the ingredients list). In the same pan that I fried the pancake, I cook some kind of meat - sometimes liver, sometimes chicken breast, sometimes ribeye steak, etc. Sometimes I have a can of sardines instead of the meat. If I'm still hungry, I'll have a kiwi or an orange. Usually, I am good with just the pancake and the meat.

For dinner, I pan-fry vegetables. One of my favorite combinations is red pepper, zucchini, mushrooms, and garlic. I often don't use any kind of fat for cooking these. The vegetables generate enough water that they don't need fat to keep from sticking to the pan. Then, I will have a piece of fish. I usually go with wild-caught cold water fish like salmon or cod. And I bulk up the meal with some kind of carbohydrate - potatoes, oatmeal, rice, quinoa, or pasta.

Somewhere in the day, I add something fermented like raw sauerkraut, kimchi, or fermented pickles.

I do the best I can to eat the way our ancestors ate. If it is not the healthiest way of eating, it is at least the way of eating followed by so many great human beings throughout history. It is the way Jesus Christ ate. It is the way Joan of Arc ate. It is the way Aristotle ate. So when I consider tradition in my eating habits, I find a sense of solidarity with all the people who came before me.

In modernity, the food has become convenient, rich, and cheap. It has also lost much of its nutritional value, its communal and familial elements, and its demand for patience and light work. This is tragic, but there is good news. Each of us has the freedom to choose what and how we eat, and there is plenty of good food out there.

## Let Some Things Slide

Life was going pretty good; at least on paper. I landed a job at a tech startup and was making way more money than I ever had before. I finished graduate school. I had my own place. I was eating right and getting plenty of exercise. I was paying off my college loans ahead of schedule.

But I hated my job. I was overwhelmed and stressed out. I had to deal with clients who were often incredibly harsh and impatient, and I was still just learning. I didn't have much of a social life, and after dealing with angry people at work I started to prefer being alone. Also, having no social life meant I had more money to put toward paying off my college loans.

I lived like that for three years. I obsessed over what I was eating and how it was making me feel. I obsessed over how much money I spent, and how much I put toward paying off my college loans. I obsessed over my exercise routine. I obsessed over writing and starting my own business so I didn't have to spend any more time at my stressful job. I was obsessed with how I felt.

I developed insomnia. On weekends, I would wake up sometime between 2:00am and 4:00am. On weekdays, I usually managed to sleep until 5:00am or 5:30am. No matter what day it was, I was obsessed with getting eight hours of sleep each night, and I felt anxious or groggy if I didn't get that. And most nights I only got between four and six hours of sleep.

I was obsessed with being healthy. Then, a few things happened that opened my eyes and enabled me to lighten up.

First, I worked out a deal with my employer so that I could move to South Carolina but keep my job in Pennsylvania. I worked remotely. I still hated my job, but I hadn't found anything better. I moved to South Carolina and rented a room in my sister and her husband's house. This meant I was living far away from my parents again.

One day, I got a phone call from my dad. I answered, but there was nothing on the other line. My mind raced. I feared the worst. Maybe he had another heart attack. Maybe something is wrong him. Maybe something is wrong with my mom. I called him back, but he didn't answer.

Partly because of frustration with my dad for calling and then not answering, and partly because I needed to let go for my own mental health, I decided that I would no longer let myself worry when I got phone calls like that. I realized that I wouldn't be able to make a difference anyway since I was a thousand miles away. I realized that life happens, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. And for the first time since my dad's heart attack, I felt a huge weight lift off of my heart.

After spending about a year in South Carolina, I moved back to Pennsylvania. Taking advantage of the fact that my job was still remote, I moved in with my parents and worked from their place. By doing that, I was able to spend quality time with them, pay off the rest of my college debt, and save up for a new car.

I still had insomnia. I still hated my job. I still obsessed over what I ate and my exercise routine. But I had learned that I could let things slide, especially if I had good reason for doing so.

Then, on my dad's birthday, I went out to dinner with my parents. Being obsessed with my diet, I was extremely picky about where we ate, and I hated the idea of eating out at all. I was actually upset that I had to go out to eat with my parents on my dad's birthday. I was upset that it disrupted my pristine diet. I was upset that I would have to feel the symptoms of it the next day.

The following week, I felt ashamed that I was upset about going out with my parents on my dad's birthday. It reminded me of the time my parents caught me smoking cigarettes. That was on my dad's birthday (years prior) too. How many birthdays was I going to damper for my dad?

My guilt taught me that there are things that are more important than eating perfectly. Taking a break from my diet in order to celebrate my dad's birthday was one of them.

A couple months after that, though, I slipped back into my perfectionist mindset. The holiday season had just passed, and I don't think I ate a single cookie or sweet. Then, I started getting severe stomach cramps. They got so bad that I went to the doctor. He had me get some blood tests and an ultrasound. Things mostly looked okay, but there was something with my blood cell counts that his assistant didn't like.

At this point, I realized that eating perfectly was futile. I ate perfectly for years, and now I was dealing with this terrible stomach cramping every time I ate.

When my blood test results came in, I got a phone call from my doctor's secretary. She said they wanted to have the cancer center review my blood work. By this time, I was pretty good at controlling panic. I was scared to death, but I managed to suppress it enough to go on living.

A couple weeks later, I got another call from my doctor's secretary. This time she said that the cancer center doesn't need to see me, but wanted me to get the same blood tests done in two months. That was actually a relief because I figured they would have brought me in sooner if things looked really serious.

Two months later, I had my blood tests done again. Soon after that, I got another call from my doctor's secretary. This time she said everything looked good. I remember exactly where I was - in a grocery store parking lot - when I got that call. I was terrified when I saw that the doctor's office was calling, and relieved when they told me everything was okay; very relieved.

Everything was okay, but I came out of that experience with a different perspective on life. I wasn't going to live forever, no matter how healthy I was. I decided that I did not need to be so strict with my diet and exercise anymore. I had come to enjoy eating healthy, and I did feel much better when I was in the habit of doing so, but I no longer fretted over deviations here and there. I stopped being obsessed.

That experience also helped me realize just how inaccurate science can be. According to numerous studies and powerful evidence, I should have been free of any health issues. Yet I had a bout of terrible stomach cramping. It turned out I just had to eat fewer high-fiber foods. Cutting down on broccoli, beans, cabbage, and Brussel's sprouts cleared the cramps up. All the literature touted the health benefits of those foods.

I realized that maybe science can't speak for every individual. Not only did that influence how I looked at diet and exercise, but it also influenced how I looked at sleep. I stopped striving so hard to achieve that magical eight hours of sleep per night. Who the heck came up with that number anyway?

I stopped worrying about how much I slept. I stopped paying any attention to it at all. I went to bed when I felt tired, and I woke up when I woke up. I still woke up very early most mornings, but it didn't cause me to feel groggy and tired all day. It turns out I only really felt groggy because I assumed I hadn't slept enough. When I came to accept that maybe I only need four hours of sleep some nights, it stopped making me feel bad.

#### The Lesson

When I started healing myself through diet and exercise, I felt better than I had in years. Unfortunately, I ended up obsessing over my diet and exercise so that I could maintain those positive feelings. That obsession became counterproductive. Instead of enjoying my health by going out to dinner to celebrate my dad's birthday, I let the deviation upset me. Instead of enjoying a couple extra hours of wakefulness, I assumed I had insomnia.

Luckily, life shook me up a bit, and I realized I was tyrannizing myself. It took some time, but I learned to stop obsessing so much over my health and how I felt.

## Hyper-Stimulation Is Toxic, Addiction Sucks Until It Is Broken

- Drinking coffee on weekends, but not during week, then getting depressed during week
- Watching YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, but losing interest in actual socializing
- Smoking weed and staying in instead of drinking and going out

ADDITIONAL TOPICS AND NOTES
## Getting over my social anxiety
-- During COVID, read USA Today article that said virus lasts 17 days on surfaces. Looked into source. Ended up being word of mouth from word of mouth from word of mouth from some random person in a team of researchers on a cruise ship. Stopped trusting information. Started realizing I was brainwashed.
-- Life is not happiness. If someone leads you to believe that people are mostly happy, they're probably trying to exploit you. They want you to believe that you need them or their product or service in order to be happy. Be wary of people who engage your emotions.
## Nutrients, electrolyte theory
-- Depressed after exercising, figure it must be a nutrient deficiency
-- Tried eating more protein, etc, but couldn't quite pin point it
-- Sister said electrolytes helped her not be sore doing crossfit
-- Friend said electrolytes gave him way more energy during biking
-- Wondered if that might be what I need because I found that you lose tons when you workout and sweat, and my depression was only coming after hard runs/workouts
-- Did some research and found studies strongly linking potassium and magnesium levels to depression and other mood disorders
-- Ordered some electrolytes [specify amounts/ratio of each electrolyte in the drink mix]
-- Didn't take them at first, but got really depressed one evening. Was going to go to an event, but couldn't bring myself to move. Sat on my bed for an hour. Then ate dinner and took electrolyte drink. Then sat on my bed for another hour. Then, after an hour or two, my mood completely changed. I was actually feeling gitty. I was almost giggly. I have been supplementing with electrolytes ever since.
-- I decided to research electroyltes further. Realized they're called electrolytes because they conduct (help neurological system transmit) neurons/electricity (which is what brain signals are made of). So, dopamine signals, if you have no electrolytes, are going to move very slow or not at all.
-- Then, at my cousin's wedding, I talked to a college student girl about psychiatry because she was working in a psychiatric hospital. She said they use electro-therapy still, but it's not like it is in the old movies. She said it makes a huge difference in depressed patients. That got me thinking about the whole depression thing more. Maybe a lot of these patients are just deficient in electrolytes.
-- I eat a very healthy diet (as you've probably read), but somehow I was still deficient. Partly that was because I sweat a lot, and you lose a lot when you sweat. Partly, though, I wonder if our whole system of farming has messed up our food supply. You see, farmers want to squeeze every ounce of profit out of the soil as they can. They fertilize with potassium, nitrate, and ____, but they are going to do that as little as they possibly can to save money. Then, on top of that, the whole reason they need to fertilize is because they have depleted the soil of nutrients with poor farming practices. So, even the healthy, whole food produce that we eat is probably lacking in electrolytes.

## Conclusion
- You may have noticed my obsession with body, mind, and soul. I have, for years, found it very helpful to organize health into those three parts. They often overlap and affect one another. Still, it helps. You can see if here. Body: exercise, eat right. Mind: kindness and honesty, learn, Soul: Virtue, prayer

## Strange paradox
Things which relieve anxiety can also cause depression and things which relieve depression can also cause anxiety. To complicate matters, things which relieve depression dan also cause depression and things which relieve anxiety can also cause anxiety. Can dopamine system stuff by Andrew  Hibernian explain this? Science hasn’t gotten there yet, but often even if the science isn’t there, there is some utility in having an explanation that actually makes sense even under scrutiny. Caffeine is an example of helps with depression but causes anxiety. Then have too much caffeine over time and dopamine depletion occurs, then depressed.

## Outline
- My worst depressive episode
- Depression is…but…
- YOU CAN GET BETTER
- But first you must decide whether you want to heal. Depression has its benefits. Desiring death opens a path of extraordinary capability in conquering dangerous tasks and adventures. Staying depressed also means you never have to put in the work that healing requires. Additionally, when life is difficult because of depression, you have a unique perspective that can be beneficial in determining your true priorities in life.
- Meditation: What if you could take that desire for, or acceptance of, death with you into a non-depressed state?
- Ultimately, though, depression is sadness beyond life’s normal moments of suffering. It is additional, unnecessary suffering.
- Depression is your body, mind, or soul trying to alert you to something.

- The second half of this is a mindset shift. Whether you have accomplished everything in the first half or not, whether you are still depressed or not, now is a great time to start thinking about this.
    - Our culture talks about mental health in terms of feelings. Do you feel good? Are you sad?
    - The problem is, we aren’t in control of our feelings most of the time.
    - At some point, you’ve got to stop asking yourself how you feel. Don’t worry about that. Practice being okay with whatever you feel, and don’t concern yourself with it.
    - On top of that, feelings are not the most valuable thing a human is capable of. Animals can feel sadness or pain too, but they cannot act differently than they feel. Humans can. We can do what is right even when we feel sad.
    - Aristotle points out that virtue is the highest human good. Ultimately, he is saying that happiness is not how you feel but how you act. How close to perfection are you in virtue? The more patient you are, the happier. The more courageous you are, the happier. The more kind you are, the happier.
    - If you let virtue be your measure of happiness, rather than feelings, you are much more in control of your happiness. Instead of asking yourself, “how do I feel this morning?” You can ask yourself “Was I patient with that old lady this morning?” Then, based on your answers, you can choose to grow, you can become happier. When you can say, “Yes, indeed, I treated that old lady with great patience,” then you have made a step toward true happiness.
    - Of course, feelings affect our abilities to some degree. If I am utterly depressed, it is going to be more difficult for me to be courageous. But if I can be courageous while I am utterly depressed, then I have extraordinary courage.
    - So, it is up to you. Heal your body and mind and soul, but also decide whether true happiness is an action or a feeling. If you decide it is an action, then get busy improving yourself in the virtues! I think you will be pleased with what you find.
    - Tips
        - Keep a journal
        - Do things that scare you
        - Look honestly at yourself, don’t just assume you’re a good person
- Seems like a lot of work, but when you start feeling better, you’ll find it’s very joyful and peaceful work. Praise God!

## Points
- I won’t go into my history or the reasons why I believe I have had these struggles, maybe in another essay. Here, I simply want to explain what my struggles have been so that anyone reading can determine whether their own problems or the problems they are studying match mine, and then what lessons and relief I found in and from these struggles.
- Being OCD as a kid, showing dad OCD symptoms, dad said no, really I’m just highly conscientious so he was right
- Learning about suicide for the first time and fearing my dad would commit, even though that was a silly fear looking back
- Then, really thinking about suicide for myself in freshmen year of HS when we watched Dead Poets Society in a class that I absolutely dreaded…the class made me feel exactly like the kid who killed himself
- Then, changing schools, meeting girls, falling in love, started writing songs
- Song writing was massive for me. I wrote a song about suicide that basically set my narrative as the guy who wants to help prevent suicides. Music seemed like the best way to do that
- Song listening was detrimental and redemptive for me. It made me feel less alone, but it also made me feel correct in some of my selfish thoughts and ideas. Nonetheless, I listened to tons of music
- I decided I wanted music to be my profession, my gift to the world
- I’m not sure when I started experiencing depression. But looking back at some of the songs I wrote in college, I suspect it was around when I was 19-years-old. [show some lyrics]
- My first panic attack was around that time as well. It was in a Barnes and Noble parking lot. My second was in a shopping mall. I had a couple other smaller ones, but those were the big ones.
- My worst experience was the lonely night…
- My dark night of the soul
