## Learn From My Struggles
Some people are insane for no apparent reason. But for most of us, there are reasons for our insanity. Uncovering those reasons and fixing the problems can bring us back to sanity. I am writing of my struggles with mental health, and the lessons I have learned, because I want to help anyone who will listen. I shied away from writing this for many years, partly because I still had too many struggles and too much to learn, and partly because I did not have the courage to expose myself in this way.

Mental health is a moving target. As we find solutions and improve, we grow accustomed to our new mental state. Our mental health baseline changes. For example, instead of feeling depressed all the time, I might only feel depressed a couple times a week. That is a relief, but as I get used to that, my baseline changes. Instead of being happy and relieved that I only feel depressed a couple times a week, feeling depressed a couple times a week becomes my normal, and then I must seek greater relief from my depression to improve my baseline. After some troubleshooting, I might solve another problem that helps me to only feel depressed once or twice a month. Once again, I am relieved. After a while, depression once or twice a month becomes my baseline. Once again, I am driven to improve.

This is my story to now. I believe my baseline level of happiness, of mental health, is far better than that of the average person. I believe I am in such a position that I can offer some degree of help to almost anyone experiencing mental health struggles.

Alas, not everyone wants help, so I am publishing this writing on my website so it is available to those who want it, and can be ignored by those who don’t want help. That said, if you want more help or have questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I am not a doctor or a psychologist, but I have spent many years studying and personally experimenting in the fields of nutrition, physiology, theology, philosophy, and psychology. I will not claim to be an expert in any of them, but I believe that gives me a unique perspective that experts in those fields lack. Because of my lack of expertise, I am able to see the human in a more holistic way. A psychologist, to be an expert in psychology, must spend all of his time studying psychology, which often overlooks topics like nutrition’s role in mental health or religion’s role in anxiety disorders.

I am not an expert. I am a human being who has spent, very intentionally, the past ten years of his life seeking true health and happiness. While many experts were seeking academic merit, career advancement, or publishing opportunities, I was seeking true health and happiness, and I was documenting my journey. That is my qualification. Maybe that counts for something, maybe it does not. Either way, I am going to share my story. I hope it helps.

As much as I would like to explain why I believe I experienced these struggles, it would not aid in getting to the point of this particular piece of writing which is to explain my mental health trials and resolutions so that anyone reading can apply my experiences and the things I have learned to their own life.

I think, ultimately, that this writing is my way of giving meaning to my struggles. As Nietsche said, "To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. He who has a why to live can bear almost any how." (CITE) Or as Viktor Frankl put it, "In some ways, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning." (Man's Search for Meaning)

That's where we should all start. We should find meaning in our struggles. Just as a pain pill might not completely cure a migrain but takes the edge off enough that we can bear it, finding (and remembering) the meaning of our struggles can take the edge off enough that we can bear them.

## Find the Meaning of Your Struggles

I found meaning in my mental struggles when I was a sophomore in high school. I had been writing songs for a couple years, but they were all just funny songs I wrote to amuse my friends. They were songs about Chapstick and pancakes and filthy things that boys talk about. I had also been a big fan of music for a couple years, but I didn't pay much attention to the lyrics. I listened to heavy metal and political punk rock. I listened to music that felt good to skateboard to.

Then, as a sophomore, my friend showed me Dude Ranch by Blink-182. It was that same kind of punk rock that complemented skateboarding, but the lyrics seemed to come from my own heart. They were about the exact same things I was struggling with - girls, love, parents. At the same time, they were funny. That album rocked my world. It helped me realize I wasn't alone. And it opened the door to the world of pop punk.

In that same period of time, I came across Simple Plan. Their songs made me feel like someone understood me. And then I found out another friend listened to Simple Plan. We talked about it, and he had the same experience as I did. He felt better when he listened to this music.

It was then that I decided that I would be a punk rock musician. That would be my dream. That would be my life. I wanted to help people the same way that Simple Plan, Blink-182, and so many others had helped me. I started writing songs about everything I was feeling.

Then, something amazing happened. Anytime I faced a new struggle - with a girl, with school, with my parents, with my job - it didn't hurt so much. Instead of looking like a monster, it just looked like fuel for my songwriting. I didn't care so much what struggles I might have to face, and I was able to let go of old struggles that haunted me.

When songwriting was my life's purpose, I thrived. I still had struggles, but they weren't threats. I wrote songs about suicide, the emotional pain of break-ups, and even stomach problems. I certainly still had struggles, but my struggles had meaning. My struggles were going to enable me to help others.

When I experienced my first panic attack, I wrote a poem about it. When I couldn't stand the loneliness I felt during my sophomore year of college, I wrote a song about it. When my grandfather died, I wrote a song about it.

#### The Lesson
If you're having trouble finding the meaning of your own struggles, spend some time looking at the works of mercy and the seven capital virtues. Both have been documented and passed down by the Catholic Church, but they can be used by anybody, Catholic or not. If you can put your struggle toward one or more of the works of mercy or capital virtues, you will find great strength.

The meaning of my struggles could have been simply to have something to write songs about, but it was when I realized that I could help others through my songs that I really found strength. The works of mercy and cardinal virtues are the highest goods that human beings can attain. If your struggles can be put toward any of them, then you have found a powerful force.

### The Corporal Works of Mercy (CITE Wikipedia)
To feed the hungry.
To give water to the thirsty.
To clothe the naked.
To shelter the homeless.
To visit the sick.
To visit the imprisoned, or ransom the captive.
To bury the dead.

### The Spiritual Works of Mercy (CITE Wikipedia)
To instruct the ignorant.
To counsel the doubtful.
To admonish the sinners.
To bear patiently those who wrong us.
To forgive offenses.
To comfort the afflicted.
To pray for the living and the dead.

### The Capital Virtues
Chastity
Temperance
Charity
Diligence
Kindness
Patience
Humility

Unfortunately, even with these beautiful tools passed down to us, finding meaning can be difficult or even impossible. Sometimes the meaning is a mystery to us. We are only human. In that case, maybe finding the meaning of your struggles is the meaning of your struggles. Maybe they are there so that you can find the meaning in them. Maybe your purpose should be to search to find the meaning. If you can find the meaning in a struggle, then you will have something valuable to share with others who are facing the same struggle.

If you can't find meaning, don't despair. There is more work to be done. There is still relief to be found. You may not understand the meaning of your mental health struggles, but there are other ways to alleviate the pain. Even if you do understand the meaning, you probably still want some relief.

As my story continues, greater struggles will come, but I will also find relief by focusing on doing the best I can with and for my body, mind, and soul.

## Breathe Heavy and Break a Sweat

I experienced my first panic attack when I was a sophomore in college. I remember exactly where I was. I was pulling into the parking lot of a Barnes and Noble book store. I had just finished eating Taco Bell and was slurping the last drops of a large Mountain Dew. I felt certain that I was going to die very soon, that impending death was upon me. I didn't know it was a panic attack. I just stayed the course. I got out of my car and walked into Barnes and Noble. I went to the poetry section and started leafing through some books. After a few minutes, the panic subsided.

When I got back to my apartment, I looked up the symptoms of a panic attack and found they matched what I experienced. I immediately wrote down what I had felt.

My sophomore year of college, I became very lonely. I barely went out. Looking back, I think things like deciding not to buy a cafeteria meal plan were very detrimental to my social life. I lost a lot of social sense that year.

My junior year was a little better. I moved into an apartment with a guy I was friends with in high school, and two of his friends. I had a roommate, so I was at least forced to see another human being every day.

That year was the next time I faced abnormal anxiety (I consider it normal to be anxious before a class speech or a big test). One of the guys who lived in the apartment with me had gone to high school with me, but someone who knew him once told me about some mean things he said about me. I can't remember what they were now, but it was enough to make me not like the guy.

At the same time, my other friend from high school really liked him, and the guy was nice to me on the rare occasion that we actually spoke. Also, he seemed important. He was quick-witted and popular. So I wanted him to like me.

A couple months into our first semester of living together, we had only spoken once and it was together with our other two apartment mates. One day, I saw that he was in his room, and I thought of something funny to say to him. I stepped into his doorway and said whatever it was, and he said, "what?" I said it again, but as I was saying it the second time, my head filled with such panic that I started to black out. If you've ever been on a roller coaster that goes so fast that you start to lose your peripheral vision, then you know what I mean when I say I started to black out. I wasn't on a roller coaster though, I was just standing in a doorway trying to say something funny to a guy I lived with.

I had the same experience in one other social interaction. Both times it was awful. Afterward, I hated myself. I had no idea how to control it or how to stop it or how to change. I just wanted to be normal. I still had a few years of struggle to go through first.

I finally found some relief after I graduated college and was working at my first real job. I worked in the marketing department of a property owners' association. My boss would play the pop music station all day long. I hated it. But one day the DJ shared a little blurb about a new study. Researchers found that exercising to the point of sweating three times per week was as effective as taking anti-depressant medication.

You won't hear that kind of news in today's mainstream media because the pharmaceutical companies pay the media companies insane amounts of money. Fortunely, the mainstream media wasn't in big pharma's back pocket back then.

At the time, I hated my job, but other than that I wasn't particularly depressed. Nonetheless, I figured the exercise might make me feel better, so I started running a few times per week. I found it was a great way to separate the work day from the evening. It helped me shake everything off.

When I couldn't stand my marketing job anymore, and I had finally made concrete plans to become a musician, I moved to California.

I lived with my grandparents in Anaheim. I found a drummer to start a band with. He helped me get a job at a music studio. Things were pretty good, but I was anxious as Hell. I would wake up wondering if the day was going to be a scary one or not.

One time, I was talking to my new boss. We were in the main studio room. It had a big stage and lots of red and black and lust. He was explaining something to me when his phone started ringing. His ring tone sounded exactly like mine, but my ring tone was one that I had recorded myself with my ukulele. My mind started racing. I wondered how he could have possibly gotten my ring tone. The only explanation I could draw was that he was the devil. The lusty red and black surroundings and his black leather pants probably didn't help.

After a minute I realized that he didn't have my ring tone. He just had a common iPhone ring tone that I used to have before I recorded my own. He ended up being a great boss. He treated me well.

Among the anxious days, I also experienced some depressed days. Those days led me to start running again. After a couple runs, I realized that running was a potent antidote to my anxiety. I felt like a new man. I found the cure I was looking for. It was amazing, and it stayed that way. Actually, I haven't had a black-out panic attack since. I did have one other panic attack, and my social anxiety still loomed over me. I will write more about both of those later. My days fogged with a general feeling of anxiety, anxiety for no apparent reason, were over.

I still run. Just yesterday I ran a 5K in 19 minutes and 12 seconds (flex). I have found that I can get by with running two miles twice a week. Any less than that and I get unnecessarily anxious or I get headaches and body aches.

Side note: I contracted Lyme's disease when I was twelve or thirteen. Body aches have been a normal part of my life ever since. Along with relieving my anxiety, running also drastically reduces the aches. Paired with a healthy diet, I now live a life that is almost entirely devoid of headaches and body aches.

#### The Lesson
If you are struggling with depression or anxiety, start exercising regularly. And when you exercise, make sure you push hard enough that you are breathing heavily and sweating. It is hard at first. Don't expect to feel motivated. Motivation comes after you have started. But if you can get started even though you don't want to, you will soon notice the benefits, and then you will be motivated. After a while, it will become habit.

This applies to all of the following lessons. They are difficult at first, but keep at them. If you just get started, a positive cycle will develop. You will start to realize how much relief these practices bring you. At the same time, feeling better will leave you with more energy to put into things like exercise. It gets easier and easier.

I have gotten to a point in my own life where doing the work to maintain a healthy mental state is actually a source of joy in itself. I am happy to do difficult things that are good for my body, mind, and soul.

I am at that point now in my life, but in this history, I was still living in California. I had more struggles to come. I had more lessons to learn.

## Fix Your Dinner
- Started eating healthy when I got my own place
- Found not so much relief, but found that my symptoms worsened when I went back to eating the wrong way
- Found relief from anger issues (hangriness and low blood sugar stuff)
- Also started to enjoy cooking and now I find it is a great source of joy, and a good way to serve others. Also, friend once said she doesn't like cooking unless it's for others. Thing is, every time you cook, you get better at cooking, so every time you cooking, you are getting better for the next time you cook for others. So, really, every time you cook can be for others.




Conclusion
- You may have noticed my obsession with body, mind, and soul. I have, for years, found it very helpful to organize health into those three parts. They often overlap and affect one another. Still, it helps. You can see if here. Body: exercise, eat right. Mind: kindness and honesty, learn, Soul: Virtue, prayer
