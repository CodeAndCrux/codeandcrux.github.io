Food shortages, sky-rocketing gas prices, pressurized housing market... we are expecting tougher times ahead.

# How I am planning to get through the tough economy

### Figure out the bare minimums I need for food
#### My personal food staples
- Fish, especially cold water fish
- Eggs, especially pasture-raised
- Greens
- Berries
- Oats
- Whatever fresh vegetables I can find
- Salt
- Whole wheat flour
- Olive oil
- Duck fat, pork lard, and/or beef tallow
- Mushrooms
- Organ meats
- Whatever fresh fruits I can find
- Carrots
- Squash
- Spices, especially pepper, cinnamon, and garlic
- Potatoes

I can live with only the top three for quite a while. The foods on my list diminish in importance as you go down.

I will look forward, as I always do, to making salsas and fermented foods like pickles, sauerkraut, kombucha, and sour dough breads.

### Other ideas
- Borrow books and audiobooks from the library instead of purchasing them
- Carpool with friends when possible
- Stop browsing on Amazon or in shopping malls. Instead, spend more time hanging out with friends
- Get a power bank if my phone battery starts getting crappy
- Switch to a cheaper cell phone plan
- Spend time cleaning and maintaining everything I own so it lasts longer and stays beautiful
- Work on ways to generate income aside from my normal job as a developer
- Ask the Lord for grace
- Purchase certain things in bulk, like deodorant, toothpaste, oats, whole wheat flour, frozen fish, and frozen berries
- Cancel subscription services like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, etc

### Questions to ask before buying something
- Will it increase, encourage, or in any way improve my relationships?
- How will it affect my savings/investing?
- Will it add beauty to my life and/or surroundings?
- Do I need it to survive?
