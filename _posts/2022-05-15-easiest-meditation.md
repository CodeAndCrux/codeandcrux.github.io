Meditation doesn't have to be difficult. You don't need to read a book to learn how to do it. You don't need to take a class. You don't need an app.

All you have to do is stop doing stuff. Sit quietly in a room alone; or stand; or pace in circles. Just be quiet and alone. Alone means no external stimuli. Put away your music, your mobile device, your TV, your books, your pen and paper, and every other medium you use to send or receive messages from other human beings.

When you are alone with silence, your meditation has begun. The lack of stimulation will allow your mind to start thinking about whatever it wants to think about. Eventually (maybe minutes, maybe hours), it will have thought enough about whatever it wants to think about, and it will be ready to let it go.

When your mind has finally turned off, simply because you sat quietly in a room alone, you have achieved that part of meditation that everybody blathers on about.

### Here are some of the benefits I have experienced from this sort of meditation
- Relaxation. Sometimes even bliss
- Epiphanies and new solutions to problems
- A deep sense of needing nothing
- Easier to silence my thoughts when I meditate regularly
- Music sounds better when I regularly live in silence

In one sense, meditation is difficult. Sitting quietly in a room alone sounds awful, but so does running a 5K. However, the benefits of running a 5K far outweigh the drawbacks. The same can be said about meditating.

At the same time, meditation is the easiest thing a human being can do. You just have to do nothing.
