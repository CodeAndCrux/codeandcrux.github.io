A couple months ago, I went for a bike ride with a priest friend. He had been taking a class on the Theology of the Body, and he shared a piece of it with me. I have thought about it almost every day since then.

When a man feels attracted to a woman, that is ultimately his God-given desire to fulfill the role that a man plays in a relationship with a woman. The role is to be woman's helper, just as woman's role is to be man's helper. By design, we need each other in order to thrive. In fact, without each other the human race would come to an end.

Thesis. Lust is acting on the tip of the iceburg of one's true calling, and missing the iceburg
1. Man and woman are designed to complement one another - man plants the seed, woman nurtures the garden
2. This design results in attraction
3. When our attraction is minimized or pinched or muzzled, we lust
4. Lust cuts off the helping part of the relationship, and becomes using instead. It is a twisting of one's conscience, a twisting of one's true desire
5. To overcome lust, we must act out our attraction, our true desire, fully by helping, in some way, the other become the fullest, best version of him/herself as God intended him/her to be. Simplest would be to pray for that the person lives according to God's will. Then, our feelings have been taken back from the devil, turned from lust into love.
