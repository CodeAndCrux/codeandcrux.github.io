It's almost midnight.<br>
The McDonald’s drive thru<br>
has six cars in line.

I am only walking by.<br>
I’m hungry for something more.<br>
I want to strive.

I want to fly.<br>
I want to taste the stars in the sky.<br>
Sure, maybe on the way I will die.

But I’d rather meet death wild<br>
than get in line<br>
for a burger and a small fry.
