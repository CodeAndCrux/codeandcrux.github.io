It's almost midnight.
The McDonald’s drive thru
has 6 cars in line.

I am only walking by.
I’m hungry for something more.
I want to strive.

I want to fly.
I want to taste the stars in the sky.
Sure, maybe on the way I will die.

But I’d rather meet death wild
than get in line
for a burger and a small fry.
