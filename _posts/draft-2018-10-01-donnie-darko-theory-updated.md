- The ultimate human temptation is the temptation to deny our fate. That is pride. It is the root of all sin. In the most extreme case, it results in suicide, but also in abandonment to vice.
- Vice turns us into the dead. Sin is death in the sense that it closes us off from the life-giving God, from true happiness, from life. Vice is sin. 
- Donnie Darko goes to the movies with Gretchen Ross, the love of his life. Frank, the bunny, appears to Donnie. Donnie asks Frank to take his mask off. Frank has a bullet wound in his eye, but Donnie hasn’t shot Frank yet. So Donnie is seeing his fate, his future.
- Then Frank tells Donnie to burn down Jim Cunningham’s house. This is Donnie’s last temptation from Frank. Donnie can either deny his fate and stay in the movie theater with Gretchen Ross, where just about any teenage boy would love to be, or he can accept his fate, obey, and go burn down Jim Cunningham’s house.
- Donnie accepts his fate. As he’s walking out of the theater, the marquee says “The Evil Dead” and “The Last Temptation of Christ”
- Donnie is the Christ figure in this movie. He must give his life to save the world. He accepts. He leaves the theater, he leaves The Evil Dead, the life of vice and pride, and he does not succumb to the last temptation. He saves the world.

*Warning: This post may contain spoilers. Honestly, though, I've watched Donnie Darko a hundred times, knowing the plot, and it still hasn't lost its value. There is so much mystery in the movie that it really can't be spoiled (in my humble opinion).*

*Donnie Darko* is my favorite film to watch during the Halloween season. It's creepy and takes place in October. Also, ***THE SOUNDTRACK***.

My affection for the movie goes beyond the great setting though. What really draws me are the theories and discussions around the plot.

At first glance, the movie is confusing and nonsensical. Even then, the characters are interesting, the romance is bold, and the humor is just right.

After digging deeper into the theories and themes of the movie, one starts to realize it is not just a movie. It is a poem. This is especially true in the sense that it can be watched over and over, and new details arise each time.

If you haven’t read up on *Donnie Darko* theory, [click this link for a good overview](https://www.salon.com/2004/07/23/darko){:target="_blank"}.

I could discuss my own theories and observations about the movie for weeks. I won’t do that, but when I watched the movie recently, I noticed something I hadn’t noticed before.

Donnie goes to the movie theater with his girlfriend, Gretchen Ross. While watching *The Evil Dead*, Gretchen falls asleep and Donnie sees Frank (the man in the bunny suit). Frank tells Donnie to go burn down Jim Cunningham’s house. Donnie does what Frank tells him. As he exits the movie theater, the theater marquee in the background says, “The Evil Dead,” and below that, “The Last Temptation of Christ.”

Those words, “The Last Temptation of Christ” are the beginning of my theory.

When he walks out of the theater, Donnie intentionally leaves a life of meaninglessness, a zombie-like life of seeking only consumption and satisfaction (like the zombies in "The Evil Dead"). He literally leaves "The Evil Dead," and he figurately leaves the evil dead.

At first, it might appear that “The Last Temptation of Christ” means Frank has tempted Donnie (the Christ figure) to burn down Jim Cunningham’s house. I believe the temptation is the opposite of that. Donnie is tempted to *not* burn down Jim Cunningham’s house.

If burning down Jim’s house is the temptation, then the “Last Temptation of Christ” sign doesn’t make sense because Donnie did burn Jim’s house down. If burning Jim’s house down is the temptation, Donnie succumbed to temptation, unlike Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ actually overcame his last temptation. He did not succumb to it. Donnie Darko was told to burn Jim's house down, but he was not tempted to do it.

Donnie would not have been tempted to burn Jim's house down. He would have been tempted to stay with his girlfriend, Gretchen Ross. He is always thinking about girls. This is made very clear in one of his hypnotherapy sessions. But even without the hypnotherapy scene, it would be pretty safe to assume that he's always thinking about girls because teenage boys, in general, are *always* thinking about girls.

At the theater, Donnie was sitting right next to his girlfriend. That is paradise for a teenage boy. That is what Donnie must have really wanted. He must have really wanted to stay there with Gretchen. However, if he had stayed then he would have disobeyed Frank (his fate, his calling), and the world would not have been saved.

Instead, Donnie looks into the face of his greatest fear - that Frank is real - and, despite the temptation, he accepts his fate.

He overcomes the last temptation, the temptation to control his own destiny, to seek only his own desires, to disobey Frank. After that, he faithfully follows the time portals that lead him even though he doesn't know exactly where he will end up. He has overcome the last temptation, and now he acts by faith.

This is where the movie really excels at expressing the human condition. Donnie wasn't sure he could save the world. When he finally believed in Frank (despite his world suggesting Frank was a hallucination) he gained the courage he needed to be able to leave Gretchen, to burn Jim Cunningham's house down. Still, after that he wasn't sure he could sacrifice himself to save the world. How could anyone be sure of such a thing? He only knew he had to follow the path that was set out for him.

Burning Jim Cunningham's house down ultimately lead to Gretchen's death. Her death, and his ability to save her, ultimately gave him the strength to give up his life. This is what it looks like when a human, not a superhero, saves the world. All the unconscious motivations. All the fortune and misfortune. The tragedy and the comedy.

Donnie has a non-super power. He can see where he needs to go. Every human can do that, though many don't know how. We have to figure out what we want and then slay the biggest, scariest dragon in our way.

Donnie can't see the whole future. He only sees as far as the space portal worm things show him. At the Halloween party, he sees that he must go to the cellar door at Grandma Death's house. He doesn't know why, but he believes in his world's fictional supernatural religion - he believes in Frank - and that gives him the faith to go "deeper than [his] feet could ever wander."

Zombies wander. The Evil Dead wander. Donnie goes deeper than wandering. Jesus Christ went exactly where he needed to go, even when he was tempted. He did not wander. Neither did Donnie. Donnie overcame the temptation, left The Evil Dead, followed Frank, and saved the world. We are all called to do the same.

Donnie Darko's last temptation is the last temptation we all face. In the face of this death-plagued existence, will we succumb to comfort, pleasure, lust, fear, sin, death, or will we accept our fate, create meaning out of chaos, live a life worthy of the calling we have received, and set the world on fire (or at least burn down Jim Cunningham's house)?

Meh, that is my ridiculous theory about the meaning of the sign behind Donnie when he exits the movie theater.
