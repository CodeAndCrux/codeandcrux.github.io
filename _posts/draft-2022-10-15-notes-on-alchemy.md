Electrolytes and how they cause our brain to conduct electrical signals is basically real life alchemy. I suspect alchemy, as it is seen in the collective unconscious, is very much symbolic of this actual mixing of metals in the brain and nervous system. I think the collective unconscious view of alchemy being this thing that wizards do to make magic is really how our ancestors explained the alchemical process in the brain. They couldn’t quite understand or explain it the way we do, in a scientific way, but they did understand and explain it, and quite rationally.

"Think about the limitations of a lot of the medicines today. We try to interact [with the brain] down at the level of pathways, so we're trying to micromanage it. What's the problem? Well, one problem is that for almost every medicine, other than antibiotics, once you stop it the problem comes right back. You haven't fixed anything. You were addressing symptoms. You weren't actually curing anything - again, other than antibiotics. That's one problem.

The other problem is you have massive amount of side effects because you were trying to interact [with the brain] at the lowest level. It's like, 'I'm going to try to program this computer by changing the melting point of copper. Maybe you can do things that way, but, my God, it's hard to program at the hardware level.

What I think we're starting to understand is that we could have access to our internal state. People who practice yoga and biofeedback and all that, those are people that uniformely will say things like 'well, the body has an intelligence.' Those two sets overlap perfectly because once you start thinking about it that way, you realize that the best locus of control is not always at the lowest level.

This is why we don't all program [computers] with a saudering iron. We take advantage of the high-level intelligences that are there which means trying to figure out which of your tissues can learn, what can they learn? Why is it that certain drugs stop working after you take them for a while? It's habituation, and so can we understand habituation, sensitization, associative learning, and these kinds of things, in chemical pathways.

I think we're going to have a completely different way of using drugs, and of medicine in general, when we start focusing on the goal states and the intelligence of our subsystems as opposed to treating everything as if the only path was micromanagement from chemistry upward."

We are going back to alchemy, and we will be better off.

The difference between the words chemist and alchemist is the "al" prefix. Etymologically, this prefix has two primary meanings. The first is "beyond." The second is "to grow, nourish."

Alchemists were interested in more than just chemistry. They were interested in growth and nourishment beyond it.

Now, alchemists are history. But they were such a powerful force in that history that they have attained a position in humanity's collective unconscious. They have become an archetype.

When you think of an alchemist, what do you think of? I think of a wizard casting metallic dust into flames and creating something new.

Carl Jung, the great psychologist, noticed that alchemists made their way into the collective unconscious (a collection of memories that are instinctively shared by humans across cultures). In fact, he wrote extensively about alchemists and their role in the human psyche.

From the Wikipedia page titled "Psychology and Alchemy":

> The fundamental thesis Jung is advancing about the relationship between Alchemy and Psychology is that for pre-scientific humans there is not a sharp distinction between subject and object and thus this leads them to unconsciously project their own inner states onto external objects (especially objects that are mostly unknown to them), so a reflective analysis of alchemical symbols becomes revelatory about the unconscious psychic life of this time period. Prior to this rational segregation of experience the world was a totally different one, phenomenologically, as people did not distinguish between the qualities of the object they were perceiving and their own values, emotions, and beliefs. It is partly for this reason that the alchemists cannot say aloud exactly what the philosopher's stone really 'is' and why there are so many different symbols for the work.
> 
> For the alchemist trying to understand matter and develop base metals into their purest form, gold, substances are grouped as being alike based on their perceived value. Jung documents as these alchemists collectively come to understand that they themselves must embody the change they hope to effect within their materials: for instance, if they hope to achieve the philosopher's stone that can redeem 'base' or 'vulgar' metals, then the alchemist too must become a redeemer figure. It became apparent to the alchemists that they were trying to redeem nature as Christ had redeemed man, hence the identification of the Lapis Philosophorum with Christ the Redeemer. The Opus (work) of alchemy, viewed through this interpretation, becomes a symbolic account of the fundamental process the human psyche undergoes as it re-orients its value system and creates meaning out of chaos. The opus beginning with the nigredo (blackening, akin to depression or nihilistic loss of value) in order to descend back into the manipulable prima materia and proceeding through a process of spiritual purification that must unite seemingly irreconcilable opposites (the coniunctio) to achieve new levels of consciousness.

Where alchemists saw chemistry and human development as, practically, a single entity, chemists do not; at least not in the same way as alchemists.

Chemists, as they relate to human development, focus directly on the chemistry, the chemicals and the pathways they traverse.

When a chemist sees that a human is in pain because he has lots of acidic chemicals in his stomach (heart burn), the chemist treats him with chemicals that turn the acidic ones into basic ones (antacids), or chemicals that stop his stomach from creating acid altogether, and then the chemist calls it a day.

This is a treatment of the symptom rather than the root cause. It doesn't actually solve the problem. Upon identifying excessive stomach acid, the chemist asks, "how do I reduce acidic chemicals in a person's stomach?" But the alchemist asks, "what is the root problem that is causing too many acidic chemicals in a person's stomach?" while at the same time asking, "what tools, internal or external, can I use to address the root problem?"

The alchemist looks beyond. Instead of fighting symptoms, the alchemist looks for the root cause. The alchemist seeks to grow and nourish through chemistry.

Jung looked at the psychological aspect of alchemy. Chemists look at the physical aspect of alchemy. But there is another aspect that has been largely untouched. That is the space where the physical and psychological aspects overlap.

We are learning now that depression is not merely chemical, nor is it merely psychological. A person doesn't necessarily become depressed solely because she has a chemical imbalance in her brain/nervous system. Likewise, she doesn't necessarily become depressed solely because she has spiritual or mental misguidance or trauma. Rather, a cyclone of chemical imbalance and spiritual and mental disturbance are most often the cause of depression.

I call it a cyclone because a minor chemical imbalance might lead to a minor mental disturbance, which results in a greater chemical imbalance which results in a greater mental disturbance, and a vicious cycle occurs.

----

Jung argued that the psychological aspect of alchemy was the deeper/truer meaning behind alchemy. It was cast onto alchemy simply because our ancestors didn't have scientific language to describe it without alchemy.

I am now proposing that, just as there is a psychological component to alchemy, there is an alchemical component to human nourishment and growth. This component also described something that our ancestors knew but lacked the scientific language to explain.

This alchemical component is not merely chemistry because a) there is a focus on getting to the root cause of an issue rather than addressing a symptom, b) there is a higher level approach to manipulating the chemical components of the brain and body (like how we program computers with higher level programming languages), and c) there is a focus on nourishment and growth rather than reacting, in a specific way, to a specific symptom.

It is about purification, like the purification of venial sin from a soul when a body drinks the blood of Christ.

Chemists have taken chemistry into our bodies in the form of drugs and even things like electroconvulsive therapy. Alchemists, especially in their archetypal form, did their work outside of the body.

I propose that alchemy - by focusing on the root cause rather than easing a symptom, by using higher level abstractions to manipulate our biological systems as opposed to doing it at a hardware/chemical level, and by focusing on nourishment and growth rather than maintenance - can do a better job than chemistry at improving life.

I would like to begin to explain that now with an example from my own experience. My knowledge of chemistry, and especially brain chemistry and neurology, is weak. But I only hope to break the ground for new discoveries, and possibly help a few other people who have had similar struggles to my own.

My journey into alchemy began when I started suffering from depression after hard runs and other intense exercise. I tried increasing my protein consumption. I tried increasing my fat consumption. I tried increasing my carbohydrate consumption. I tried sleeping more. I tried drinking more water. Nothing was working. I would run, suffer from depression for a day or two, and then feel normal again.

This was clearly not an issue of mental disturbance, at least not entirely. I could literally switch it on by going for a hard run. It was, at least partly, a physical issue.

One day, a friend of mine told me that taking electrolytes gave him far greater endurance and energy on long bike rides. Around the same time, my sister also mentioned electrolytes.

I am very cautious about taking any kind of supplements. On top of that, I eat a very nutritious diet, so I didn't think I could be suffering from any kind of electrolyte deficiency.

* Alchemy can be used to free us from dependence on foreign suppliers of supplements. It's quite easy to create your own potassium, for instance, which has been linked to mood and depression. (https://sciencing.com/make-potassium-carbonate-7480553.html)
*  A next step *beyond* chemistry, that is the a step in the field of alchemy, might be to determine exactly what chemical reactions occur when the brain is deficient versus sufficient in, say potassium. The chemist might see that increased potassium levels in the body provide relief from the ennui that is a symptom of depression. The alchemist might see the same, but then also ask why it provides relief, what is the chemical reaction that it aids in (if any)? What negative effects might it also cause? And should ennui be relieved with alchemy, or is it better for the person to experience it fully for a time?
* Even though alchemists no longer exist - they've been replaced by chemists - they still occupy significant space in our culture: Fullmetal Alchemist, The Alchemist, Frankenstein, Harry Potter series, Indiana Jones and The Philosopher's Stone, the song *Alchemy* by Dire Straights, and numerous video games including Minecraft, Castlevania, RuneScape, Pokemon Sun and Moon, and Shovel Knight. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy_in_art_and_entertainment)
* Alchemy went away when chemistry came about, around Isaac Newton's time. Newton practiced alchemy. After reading many of his writings on the subject, John Maynard Keynes (the great economist) said Newton “was not the first of the age of reason, he was the last of the magicians.” (https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/januaryfebruary/feature/newton-the-last-magician)
* Before you call me out for being "new age" or anything like that, let me also tell you that many Catholic priests, including Saint Thomas Aquinas, practiced alchemy. (https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01272b.htm)
* Sister Trisha also mentioned that cooking with wood (potassium comes from wood ash) may have resulted in higher potassium levels by natural eating/cooking methods.
* Inner alchemy. How can we document, practice, and use alchemical reactions within our own minds and bodies for nourishment and growth.
-- Also involves bringing our internal chemicals to the outside and seeing how they react. How does dopamine react with potassium? How do the electrical signals react? Do they burn it up?
* Thesis: we need to bring back the field of alchemy for two reasons:
-- 1) To study and build a higher level "programming language" based on known low-level chemical knowledge, so that we have an abstract tool to produce changes in the body and mind
-- 2) To study chemistry's effects on overall life, growth, and nourishment rather than just its effects on specific symptoms
* Mythical alchemy went beyond elements and chemicals and mixtures. It involved, as chemistry does, electricity and temperature. But even beyond that, it involved writings on the ground, waving of hands, and other movements. In this regard, yoga and biofeedback are both very much forms of alchemy. They influence and effect the electricity and chemistry in the body.
* What can we learn from alchemy about our bodies and minds?

-- Depressed after exercising, figure it must be a nutrient deficiency
-- Tried eating more protein, etc, but couldn't quite pin point it
-- Sister said electrolytes helped her not be sore doing crossfit
-- Friend said electrolytes gave him way more energy during biking
-- Wondered if that might be what I need because I found that you lose tons when you workout and sweat, and my depression was only coming after hard runs/workouts
-- Did some research and found studies strongly linking potassium and magnesium levels to depression and other mood disorders
-- Ordered some electrolytes [specify amounts/ratio of each electrolyte in the drink mix]
-- Didn't take them at first, but got really depressed one evening. Was going to go to an event, but couldn't bring myself to move. Sat on my bed for an hour. Then ate dinner and took electrolyte drink. Then sat on my bed for another hour. Then, after an hour or two, my mood completely changed. I was actually feeling gitty. I was almost giggly. I have been supplementing with electrolytes ever since.
-- I decided to research electroyltes further. Realized they're called electrolytes because they conduct (help neurological system transmit) neurons/electricity (which is what brain signals are made of). So, dopamine signals, if you have no electrolytes, are going to move very slow or not at all.
-- Then, at my cousin's wedding, I talked to a college student girl about psychiatry because she was working in a psychiatric hospital. She said they use electro-therapy still, but it's not like it is in the old movies. She said it makes a huge difference in depressed patients. That got me thinking about the whole depression thing more. Maybe a lot of these patients are just deficient in electrolytes.
-- I eat a very healthy diet (as you've probably read), but somehow I was still deficient. Partly that was because I sweat a lot, and you lose a lot when you sweat. Partly, though, I wonder if our whole system of farming has messed up our food supply. You see, farmers want to squeeze every ounce of profit out of the soil as they can. They fertilize with potassium, nitrate, and ____, but they are going to do that as little as they possibly can to save money. Then, on top of that, the whole reason they need to fertilize is because they have depleted the soil of nutrients with poor farming practices. So, even the healthy, whole food produce that we eat is probably lacking in electrolytes.
-- On top of this, we heavily salt our foods with purified salt, so we have an imbalance of sodium and the other electrolytes, and the balance is important in a chemical reaction and the conduction of electricity too.
