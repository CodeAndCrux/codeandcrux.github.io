## Rest to Fight Oppression

Aldous Huxley, who wrote one of my favorite novels of all time, *Brave New World*, talked about "The Ultimate Revolution" (Video: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwinhsnEw5T6AhXCGFkFHWesBTIQtwJ6BAgQEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2WaUkZXKA30&usg=AOvVaw0UdPOtQAAYdXxDO3APW_VU, Transcription: https://publicintelligence.net/aldous-huxley-1962-u-c-berkeley-speech-on-the-ultimate-revolution/).

The idea is that there is a controlling oligarchy in the world. There always has been, and there likely always will be, and humanity is discovering powerful techniques for controlling and manipulating people.

An example of a controlling oligarchy in The New Testament is the Roman government.

In The New Testament, though, The Final Revolution had not yet occurred. The Roman government oppressed mostly by means of violence.

In The Final Revolution, the controlling oligarchy uses all of the advances in science and psychology to oppress. They don't need violence. In fact, it's better for them to avoid violence. When controllers oppress with violence, the oppressed eventually get fed up with it and fight back.

In The Final Revolution, the controlling oligarchy oppresses in a more sinister way. It oppresses using "a method of control by which a people can be made to enjoy a state of affairs by which any decent standard they ought not to enjoy." It oppresses by convincing the oppressed that they enjoy their oppression.

In *Brave New World*, the controlling oligarchy uses a number of tactics, many of which were only fantasies when Huxley wrote the book. Now, it almost seems like *Brave New World* has been used as a playbook by the controlling oligarchy. We can recognize almost all of the tactics in our own culture.

The brave new world's tyrants, for one, provided the citizens with a drug called Soma. The modern parallel to Soma is opiates, and considering big pharma's hold on advertising, politics, and the broadcast media, it could easily be considered part of the controlling oligarchy.

Another tactic used in Brave New World is the provision of endless amusement. The citizens play a game called electro-magnetic golf, which is basically a video game that is not nearly as stimulating as today's video games.

They also have music constantly playing, another form of amusement that can be commonly found in our own world. We are exposed to it everytime we go to a grocery store or gas station, everytime we get in our car, and often even while we are at home. Music, a source of stimulation that was once only available at specific times and in specific places, is now available any time and any place. And the lyrics are often full of references to casual sex.

As often seems to be the case in our own culture, relationships are primarily about sex in the brave new world. Promiscuity is encouraged and commitment is discouraged. Emotional attachment is frowned upon. That, once again, sounds eerily familiar in our own world full of pornography, hyper-sexualized advertising, contraception, and the popularization of terms like "friends with benefits" and "one-night stand."

Speaking of terms, manipulating the language used by the citizens is another control tactic. There are, sadly, many examples of this in our own culture as well. One example is Facebook - a part of the controlling oligarchy because it has such influence over our communications and information - calling the people who they allow to censor and control the messages posted on their platform "fact-checkers."

Another example, going back to the sexualization of our culture, is the use of the term "pro-choice" to make a phrase that actually means "pro-abortion" more pallatable. By the way, isn't the fact that they don't call it "pro-abortion" an indicator that they know abortion is wrong? If abortion is fine, then why not just say "pro-abortion?"

At first glance, many of these things sound incredible. Sex with tons of different people and no consequences? Amazing! Free video games for all? Hell yeah! Drugs so I never have to experience mental or physical pain? Sign me up! But alas, it is a facade masking prison walls. Whether through conscious efforts, or even subconscious efforts, the controlling oligarchy is fighting to maintain control and we often sacrifice our important things for small amusements and dopamine boosts.

One important thing we often give up is our day of rest. We do so willingly in exchange for money, comfort, pleasure, etc.

It may be wise for each person to contemplate how they spend their Sundays. Do I rest by scrolling through social media? Do I rest by binge-watching TV shows? Do I rest by having brunch and a few mimosas? Do I take any time at all to rest, or do I just do the work I put off all week? Do I worship? Do I rest in God?

Proper rest (worship) is a time when all of the noise, all of the stimulation, is turned off. We aren't trying to feel good or experience excitement or earn something. Proper rest gives us time to contemplate our lives, to wonder if we are truly happy. It gives us the time, knowledge, and energy to develop prudence. In that regard, it could save us from the manipulations of the controlling oligarchy.
