## Work is Important

Lest I diminish the importance of work, I want to leave you with a fascinating discovery that Carl Jung made in regards to work and mental health.

He argued that in order to overcome mental health issues (like depression and anxiety), one must discover "a role as one of the actors in the divine drama of life." (The Symbolic Life)

To make this clear, Jung tells the story of when he met a chief of the Pueblo tribe in the mid-1900s. The chief told Jung, "yes, we are a small tribe, and these Americans, they want to interfere with our religion. They should not do it, because we are the sons of the Father, the Sun...We must help him daily to rise over the horizon and to walk over Heaven. And we don't do it for ourselves only: we do it for America, we do it for the whole world." (The Symbolic Life)

Jung acknowledges that, to many in our modern culture, the chief's idea sounds archaic, but he also points out that the tribe's members did not suffer from mental health issues like so many in our modern society do. They didn't suffer from anxiety, eating disorders, addictions, or depression. The tribe was full of functioning members who each saw their role as "actors in the divine drama of life." This enriched their lives with meaning and purpose.

Imagine having a job that is so important that the sun wouldn't rise if you didn't get up and work.

Just like the greatest rest comes from God, the greatest work also comes from God. The tradition of the Catholic Church breaks things down for us by giving us the corporal and spiritual works of mercy (feed the hungry, instruct the ignorant, etc).

If you're feeling neurotic, you might find it worthwhile to practice some of the works of mercy. You might especially find consolation if you do these works, like the Pueblo tribe, for God and for the whole world rather than for a paycheck, the respect of others, or reputation.

Viktor Frankl also had this idea...
