>"But woe to you who are filled now, for you will be hungry."
>
>Jesus Christ, Luke 6:25

I must admit, Luke 6:25 was quite a dilemma for me. **If the well-fed will be hungry, then aren't I doing a disservice by feeding the poor? Aren't I stealing a hungry man's coming satisfaction by feeding him now?**

In Luke 14:13-14, Jesus said, "But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed."

This seemed like a contradiction to me. Jesus says, "woe to you who are filled now," but he also tells us to feed the poor. If we feed the poor, they will be filled, and "woe to you who are filled now."

I thought and prayed about this paradox for a couple months. One day I would think I understood it. Then a couple weeks later, I would realize there was a hole in my logic. Recently, I decided to ask my friends, including a priest, about it.

They gave me several good answers, but none seemed to tie up all the loose ends.

Here are some of their answers and my objections to them.

| Friend's Answer | My Objection |
| --- | --- |
| The end does not justify the means, so not feeding the hungry (the means) for the sake of letting them be blessed (the end) is not just. In other words, it's not okay to do evil in order to achieve a greater good. | "The end does not justify the means" is only valid if the means is evil. Not feeding the hungry isn't necessarily evil. It may be passively evil, but it's not actively evil. I either feed the poor and they are no longer hungry, or I don't feed them and they remain hungry, and based on my understanding of Luke 6:25 (at the time) it is better for a person to remain hungry. In that case, feeding the poor is the active act, and it may be evil if I do it knowing that it is detrimental to their soul. |
| --- |
| God can take evil and use it for good, but that doesn't mean we should do evil. | Yes, but if Jesus says, "Blessed are you who are now hungry," then aren't I doing evil by feeding the hungry? |
| --- |
| Feeding the hungry and being well-fed are mutually exclusive. I could feed a hungry man, and he could still be spiritually hungry. He could also choose to remain physically hungry by not eating all I have given him. | This is true, but I am still tempting the hungry man to eat. So, I thought, I am still pushing him closer to satisfaction where he will be further from Heaven. |
| --- |
| Sin has a lot to do with intent. If a person intends to do good, but the outcome is bad, he has not necessarily sinned. | Yes, so if I believe hunger will bring a man closer to God, yet I feed him, I am do something that I know will bring him further from God, and so there is some intention there. |

Despite my objections, I was fairly satisfied after we finished our conversation. But as I was driving home, my mind kept ruminating on the paradox. I wanted to make damn sure I could fully articulate why this is a *paradox* and not a *contradiction*.

>paradox: a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.

>contradiction: a combination of statements, ideas, or features of a situation that are opposed to one another.

After a good night's sleep, I started writing down my thoughts. That is, for me, the best way to find answers.

As I was writing, I realized two things:
- My friends gave great answers, and they were totally right. I think they were looking at this from a much more practical perspective than I was.
- My problem was not with their answers. It was that I needed to shift my whole paradigm of thought on this. I needed an answer to a more fundamental question.

In fact, I already had the answer I needed. I just didn't connect it to this particular dilemma.

A few months ago, I was confused about why a loving God would send the rich away empty, and why The Blessed Mother would rejoice at such a thing.

>"The hungry he has filled with good things; the rich he has sent away empty."
>
>Mary Mother of Jesus, Luke 1:53

I wondered, "does he only love the poor? If so, then his love is conditional, and that goes against the Christian idea that God's love is unconditional."

****LEFT OFF HERE. NOT SURE I AM SATISFACTORILY ANSWERING WHY GOD "SENDS THE RICH AWAY EMPTY"
A loving God would not hate the rich, would he? A loving God would not exclude those who come to him. If the rich simply do not go to God because they do not desire him... sure, I get that. But Luke 1:53 implies that the rich have come to him. It says he sends them away.

The answer to the paradox is love, as always. I have yet to find a serious question to which the answer is not love.

>"Love is the answer, at least to most of the question in my heart, like why are we here, and where do we go, and how come it's so hard."
>
>Jack Johnson, Better Together

A loving God does not see wealth as good, nor does he see it as evil. In the same way, he does not see poverty as good, nor does he see it as evil. A man can be poor and desire riches more than he desires God. A man can be rich and desire God more than he desires riches.

From that perspective, the well-fed becoming hungry is not a bad thing. It is the thing that the well-fed need in order to find and maintain true happiness. Likewise, the rich being sent away empty is not a bad thing. It is exactly what the rich need in order to find and maintain true happiness.

It is the reason we enjoy stories. The comfortable, set-in-his-ways, well-fed hero needs to be sent away. He needs to be hungry or he will never go looking for food. He will be a slave to his comfort, trapped. He will never go on a great adventure. And without an adventure, he will never learn or obtain anything resembling real happiness.

Before I though of "woe to you who are filled" as a death sentence. I thought of it as, "you who are filled will go to Hell." But it is more like, "I will give each individual what he or she needs in order to find true happiness."

Approaching the paradox through that lens, I was able to see how truly satisfying my friends' answers were.

It's not like I am sending my brother to Hell or making him hungry by feeding him a good meal. I am simply giving him a gift. If he becomes well-fed by it, it is okay, God will give him what he needs. After all, what man, no matter how rich, has gone through without any suffering? God gives it to all of us when we need it.

On the same token, I am not obtaining Heaven by my own ability to fast or live in hunger. I am ashamed that I am so prideful to even think such a thing. I gain Heaven through God's grace. I gain Heaven when he makes me hungry, and when he feeds me; when he makes me suffer and when he gives me peace. I gain Heaven by God giving me what I need, and if I cannot get myself to Heaven, then how could I ever get my brother to Heaven?

Allow me to go on a bit of a tangent to answer a related question that might arise. There are occasions when one of us might actually cause someone else to sin. Jesus spoke of it when he said, "whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea (Matthew 18:6)."

Notice that Jesus is speaking of "little ones" in that verse. Children are impressionable and are not responsible for themselves, so it is expected that a loving parent might indeed withhold food from their child in order for their child to remain healthy. Parents do this all the time when they limit how much candy a child can eat. 

Alas, feeding a man and causing a child to sin are very different things. Men can be tempted, but they cannot be forced to sin.

>"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."
>Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

Because of our free will, one man cannot cause another man to sin. However, because their minds are not fully developed, it is possible to cause a child to sin. If that is done intentionally, it is evil.

I cannot cause a hungry man to sin by feeding him, and I think that was my original concern.

As with most paradoxes, if not all, finding the truth within them is difficult.

Put simply, Christ's words in Luke 6:25 say, "God is so just that he even balances your hunger."

It is a relief that God is not unpredictable like some madman who might feed or beat the hungry on a wim. God is just.

Feeding the hungry is not taking away their best chance at Heaven. In fact, in feeding the hungry, I may be an instrument of God's grace. In withholding food from the hungry, I may also be an instrument of God's grace. However, I cannot know what the individual needs. Only God knows that. For that reason, the end cannot justify the means. I cannot know the end, and so I must listen to my conscience and love as well as I can. God will bring the justice. Through that and his mercy, he gives each person what her or she needs in order to enter his kingdom.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter if a person is rich or poor. God treats the poor with love and the rich with love - that looks different for each - it looks like being sent away to the rich and it looks like being fed to the poor. Whatever a person is doesn't concern me. What I am doesn't concern me because God will give me the grace I need if I ask for it. However, he does tell us to feed the poor, to help those in need, to die for our friends.

Another way to look at it is that God balances yin and yang. He balances order and chaos. He is mercy and justice. He can do this because he knows everything. We, however, do not know everything. I don't even know what I need at times, so how can I know what another person needs? Sometimes I can tell, but often I am a fool. So God gave us simple commands of providing comfort to others and stepping into discomfort ourselves. When we step into chaos, we learn better how to produce order.

What solace! I find peace in believing that, if I seek God with good intention, he will give me what I need, whether that is hunger or satisfaction.
