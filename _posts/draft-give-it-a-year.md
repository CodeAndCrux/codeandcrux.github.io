If you want to develop a virtue or character trait, give it a year. Commit to one year of dedicated effort toward developing yourself. The results will amaze you.

I usually prefer not to honk my own horn, but I believe sharing the story of my past year will inspire you to develop yourself.

My growth started in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The world was in ashes.

At first, the pandemic amused me. I had no social life before it, so the only change was that I was now able to work from the comfort of my parents' home. It was great for the first month or two.

Then, bad news and bad rumors came around. The death rate in Italy was estimated to be around 10%. And news outlets jumped at any opportunity to share the stories of those stubborn young people who wouldn't quarantine, and ended up getting very sick or dying from COVID.

Every thinking person in the United States was forced to confront their death. I was plagued with anxiety.

I remember unloading groceries in the garage with my dad, and wiping everything down with peroxide in an attempt to limit our exposure to COVID. As a healthy man in his early thirties, my chances of surviving the illness were good. My parents, not quite as healthy, and in their sixties, were at greater risk. I feared losing them.

It seems that I grow (toward happiness? toward virtue?) when I face my deepest fears.

As spring turned to summer, COVID cases decreased. By the fourth of July, things looked good. My parents invited a few family friends over for dinner and a bonfire.

After enjoying hot dogs, hamburgers, potato salad, watermelon, and beer, we walked down the road to watch fireworks. Then we sat around the bonfire and talked.

At one point, the conversation turned to Zantac, the pharmaceutical drug for easing the symptoms of acid reflux.

A gastroenterologist prescribed me Zantac when I was in eigth grade. I took it daily from then until two years after I graduated college; around 10 years total. After those ten years, news of antacid drugs causing anemia had spread, so I decided to try healing my acid reflux by eating healthier. I was successful, so I stopped taking Zantac around 2014.

Now, in 2020, around the bonfire, a friend was informing me that the makers of Zantac were being sued because the drug caused a slew of long-term negative side effects including increased risk of pneumonia, anemia, liver damage, irregular heart beat, and cancer.

I was already anxious about getting together with people during this pandemic. Learning that I might suffer serious side effects, including death, from my prior Zantac use put me into a panic. If I slept that night, it was only for a few minutes in between hours of tossing and turning.

The next day, I went for a walk. Walks are excellent for thinking. I was able to acknowledge my fear. I had to. It had its nose right up against my own. It was looking me straight in the eye.

I reasoned that I was young, healthy, and had been off Zantac for years. But mostly, I accepted that I might die soon and painfully. I think most of us who lived through the pandemic had to accept that.

That may seem morbid, but that acceptance brought a good deal of bliss and wisdom. The power of acknowledging one's death is evident in the words of the philosopher and emperor, Marcus Aurelius: "Don’t behave as if you are destined to live forever. What’s fated hangs over you. As long you live and while you can, become good now."

When we see death in front of us, we have a much clearer vision of what we value. It is easier to know what is important when we realize how little time we have to live.

For the next year, I contemplated. I wondered what I really wanted, who I should be, why I was where I was.

My most shocking realization was that fear played a significant role in almost every major life decision I had ever made. And it wasn't just fear of death. It was fear of silly things like discomfort and embarassment.

It worked out alright. I had a good job, a reliable car, good relationships with my parents and sisters, and had paid off my college loans in just a few years. But at the same time, I had been failing, for more than ten years, to attain some of the things I considered most valuable: friendship and romantic love.

After I realized that, I started noticing how much fear played a role in everyones decisions. It seemed a plague worse than the pandemic. I noticed my neighbors and friends being controlled by means of fear.

I decided that living by fear was worse than dying, and fear doesn't guarantee survival anyway.

I can state that decision in a couple sentences here, but it took me a while to realize it. My first big step occurred in January of 2021. The same guy who told me about the Zantac lawsuit asked if I would join his church choir group. That scared me, so I did it. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to be a church choir musician or not, but that didn't matter. I knew I wouldn't really know what I wanted if fear was obstructing my view.

We played at a few Sunday morning Masses. It got easier every time. After I got past the fear, I truly enjoyed it. Best of all, I realized that I could do something in spite of my terror. I could play guitar and sing well in front of a church full of people even though I was nearly blinded by panic.

Until then, I wasn't aware that I could separate my fear from my enjoyment of something. I thought that if I was afraid, I couldn't enjoy it. But I learned that fear and enjoyment are separate. Of course it's no fun to panic for an hour, but in between the moments of panic, I felt focused and present. I felt like I was doing what I was supposed to do. I felt happy.

In July of 2021, I met a beautiful woman on a dating app. Yet again, I was terrified. I asked her to lunch and she accepted. I didn't sleep the night before. I thought I might throw up at any given moment. I went for a run in the morning to calm my nerves (that helps a ton, by the way).

I told myself, "even if this date goes terribly wrong, I will be happy because I exercised such tremendous courage."

I'm no Don Juan, but the date went well enough that she agreed to go on a second one! I was really proud of myself, too, because at the end, I even initiated a hug and asked her to meet again. I know I sound like a dork being proud of something like that, but I was in a bad place. Social anxiety is no joke.

We went on a couple more dates, but ultimately she ended things. I was happy. I learned I could commit acts of courage that I once thought impossible. I was also grateful that such a beautiful woman actually found me worthy of a second and third date. At the same, I was heartbroken.

(this is a side note/separate) I won't pretend I understand why she stopped being attracted to me. Attraction is a great mystery, even to the Don Juans of the world. I also won't pretend I didn't try to figure it out. I literally wrote an entire book (hundreds of pages) about how and why women are attracted to men. I researched and tested and analyzed my past relationships; the whole nine yards. A few months later, when I thought I had everything figured, I went on a date with another woman - not as beautiful, but kind - I made none of the mistakes I had made with the first woman, yet I failed again. The second woman broke things off after the first date.

I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what went wrong. My final conclusion is that attraction is a great mystery. There were probably a million reasons why it didn't work out, and 999,999 reasons why it could have.

That failure launched me. I have, since, come to believe that the more painful a failure is the stronger it will drive a person towards success. As long as it doesn't stop them from trying, it will propel them.

My failure with that woman hurt like hell. I never wanted to make the same mistakes again. I never wanted to feel that pain again, so I needed to improve. Hating my failure, every inch of my being thrust me toward betterment.

Around the same time, the pandemic was easing up and I was called back into the office for work. I moved out of my parents' house so that I could be closer to the office, and because I knew that moving out would help me grow.

The last time I lived alone, I hated it. I thought too much. I made dumb decisions. I was bored and depressed. This time, though, I went into it realizing that I would need close relationships to avoid loneliness. I needed close relationships to be happy. Moving away from my parents left a void that needed to be filled with other relationships. That was kind of the point.

As soon as I moved out, I started making plans. At the same time, I was still navigating the heartbreak I had run into a month before. In a moment of despair, I thought, "what can I do to get my mind off of this woman?" 

The only diversion that seemed powerful enough was fear. That thing which oppressed me for years, which beat me into near-reclusion, was now my greatest relief.

Thrills like racing down a hill on my bike, clinging to the side of a rock wall, and giving a speech to a group of strangers, were the only activities that were potent enough to distract my mind from the sorrow of losing such a great woman.

Those also happened to be the activities that would help me to face my fears of death, discomfort, and embarrassment.

I started by signing up for a rock climbing class. It was a four week class, so the commitment wasn't overwhelming. As soon as I was comfortable with that, I joined Toastmasters. That was more of a commitment, but the group members were (and are) extremely supportive. Around the same time, I started going on bike rides with my coworkers. After I was comfortable with those new tasks, I joined a couple church groups.

Being distracted from my heartbreak was wonderful. Growing in courage was great. But, when winter came, I started to feel a little overwhelmed. It wasn't that I was too busy. It was that, well, I'm not sure exactly. I was still dealing with social anxiety. I was still dealing with moments, even days, of loneliness. And the cold weather didn't help motivate me to keep moving.

After two years of pandemic, several life-changing realizations, and tremendous efforts to grow, I still felt pretty much the same. Then, things got worse. I got into another relationship. This time, the girl ended it after the first date. I started thinking there was something seriously wrong with me, and whatever I was doing to fix it wasn't working.

I believe I now understand the pain that many anorexic teenage girls feel. During those dark winter months, I often looked in the mirror and thought, "I'm not that unattractive, am I?" Then the next day, I would look again and see a caricature of myself, emphasizing every little flaw. I felt hideous. I hated myself.

Looking in the mirror now, I know I am not as beautiful as some Hollywood star, but I am certainly not as ugly as I looked when I saw myself in the mirror during those winter months. Somehow my view of myself had been drastically distorted.

I went deep during the winter. I went deep. I questioned my core beliefs. I questioned everything. I hated myself. I worshipped myself. I prayed. I screamed. I doubted. I cried. I sang. I wrote.

I think I gained more wisdom than I ever had before. I realized that the only things I really cared about were relationships. I realized that I know very little, but believe quite a bit. I realized that I need nothing. There are many things that I want, but I need nothing. I realized that I was going to have to spend the rest of my life with myself, and so I would much rather be a kind companion than a disgusted one.

I could, and maybe will, write separate essays on each of those realizations. In this essay, I think the following description of my refrigerator door does a good job at portraying my development through the winter.

Before winter, I had written "Courage" on a piece of paper and hung it on my refrigerator. Now, we are approaching the end of May. That piece of paper is still hanging on my fridge, but it also has written on it, in small letters, "Loosen Up." And there is a new piece of paper hanging on my fridge now that says, "LOVE HUMAN BEINGS."

Everything I have learned thus far in my life, and especially since the begining of the pandemic, has culminated in the realization that relationships with human beings are my highest priority. Relationships are where I find peace and happiness.

It took a lot for me to realize that relationships matter more to me than money or comfort or excitement or pleasure or shiny new things. And I am not just talking about romantic relationships. I am talking about all kinds of relationships.

Fortunately, I kept a journal throughout these years. When I was deep in the despairs of winter, I read through my journal. It reminded me how energized and happy I felt when I attended a church gathering, gave a speech at Toastmasters, and chatted with my coworkers on long bike rides. Remembering those moments motivated me to continue, to cultivate and maintain those relationships.

When I made the conscious decision to show up, I gained a second wind. I was no longer doing these things to distract myself from a broken heart. I was no longer doing them to overcome fear or to develop courage. I was no longer doing them to avoid failing with another woman. I was doing them because I fell in love with the people I was doing them with.

The COVID-19 pandemic was a journey for every one of us. It may be, for better or worse, the most significant event any of us will ever experience.

For me, the journey was one of tremendous growth. I grew far more than I ever thought possible. It started with fear.

>"Where your fear is, there is your task."
>
>Carl Jung

I had to come to grips with my own mortality and fragility. I had to accept embarrassment. I had to learn to live with discomfort.

When I realized that fear was oppressing me, I knew I had to face it if I was ever going to be free. I faced it and developed courage. Then I met a beautiful woman. Then I lost her.

>"Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything."
>
>C.S. Lewis

It turns out that facing fear is a great distraction from sorrow. In many ways, losing her helped me grow.

I did the things I was most afraid to do. I joined communities. I gave speeches. I climbed rock walls. I committed to relationships. I thought I was doing everything right. I thought I would not suffer the loss of another romantic relationship.

Then it happened, and I questioned everything. Am I broken? Am I a narcissist? Am I a bottom-feeder? Am I ugly? Am I eternally alone? Is God real? Will the sun rise tomorrow? If Jesus said, "woe to you who are well-fed," then why am I supposed to feed the poor. Won't that cause them woe? Is pleasure the answer? Is virtue just a bunch of bull? Am I trapped? Should I get plastic surgery to make myself less ugly? Will plastic surgery make me less ugly? Do women care about looks? Is it my soul that is ugly? Is it my personality that is ugly? Am I too nice? Am I too mean? Am I too self-absorbed?

>"Question everything. Learn something. Answer nothing."

>Euripides

I learned a lot. Perhaps the greatest thing I learned was that I would rather live with someone, myself, who is kind and honest than someone who is neither. Instead of thinking about a regret and saying, "I'm such an idiot," I started saying, "I just didn't know better. I have learned now. I will do better next time. It's okay."

I kept a journal throughout the pandemic. When I was tired of the anxiety I felt regarding my new social commitments, I read through it and realized how important those newly formed relationships were. I realized how much love I felt for my fellow Toastmasters, the coworkers I ride bikes with, and the friends I made through church groups. I realized that those kind, honest, loving relationships were all I really cared about.

Where I once felt tremendous fear, I now find tremendous peace. My adventure is not yet finished, but I now look forward to it.
