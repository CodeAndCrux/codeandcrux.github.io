Before clocks, life was not measured so much in hours or minutes, and even days and years were less important.

When you’re on your death bed, would you rather think of the minutes or the moments.

Think about your life so far in terms of time. It doesn’t seem very long does it? It goes by in a flash. But think about all the moments, the memories, and you have some substance.
