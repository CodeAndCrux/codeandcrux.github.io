Look at the pictures, young one.<br>
Oh, the way Orion danced across the sky.<br>
He danced as slow as honey flows<br>
&ndash; in perfect rhythm, though.<br>
We watched him every winter night.

He danced and glowed. Each lustrous node<br>
was notched with reverie and delight.<br>
Oh, the way he danced so free (and leisurely),<br>
Unbound, at liberty, untied!

Look at the pictures, young one.<br>
Oh, the sight, Orion danced away the night.

It is so no more.

His light has been obscured.<br>
Man and Mammon waged their war. 

They hid him in the sky<br>
behind thirty thousand satellites.<br>
Stars that could be bought and sold<br>
were slung like nets upon his home.

Oh, he used to dance, child.<br>
We watched him move so gracefully.<br>
But now the night time sky is glowing<br>
bright with forgeries.

Orion's hands and feet are bound.<br>
His dance no longer seen.<br>
He's been uncrowned,<br>
his radiance drowned,<br>
lost behind a spellbound screen.
