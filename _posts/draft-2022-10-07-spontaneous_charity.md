I was at Mass the other day. A friend of mine was sitting a few pews in front of me. There was an empty pew in front of her, and an elderly couple sitting in the pew in front of that. When everybody kneeled, the old man was wiggling a little bit. My friend stood up, stretched forward, and pulled down the kneeler that was beind the old man. It must have been catching on his feet. My friend notice and she helped him out without any prompting. It was beautiful.

Too often, we get caught in the mindset of charity being a thing for charities. Non-profit organizations often do good things. Charitable organizations often play positive roles in society. But should not be the only source of good. In fact, they can only do very specific types of good.

The world also needs spontaneous charity. The world needs people, like my friend, to notice needs and serve without filtering that service through an organization.

It is good to serve soup to hungry people, but what about just taking a moment to acknowledge a hungry person's existence? What about feeding their spirit? What about listening to what they have to say? We cannot just keep sticking free food and money in their faces. They need deeper help. We can only help them if we take the time to listen to them, to find out what they truly need.

And we shouldn't just be doing this for homeless or hungry people. We should be doing this for everybody. All of us are terrible and broken and needy. We need to help each other.

Organized charity is good, but it can also turn those significant small acts into loveless, joyless ones. It can suck the healing power out of good works for the receiver and the giver. It can do this by turning free gifts into records in a ledger. It can do this by giving the people in charge a paycheck at the expense of good people. It can do this by drowning love in paperwork and beauracracy.

We don't need organizations in order to do good things. We can do good now. We can do good everywhere. All we need to do is look and listen and step up.
