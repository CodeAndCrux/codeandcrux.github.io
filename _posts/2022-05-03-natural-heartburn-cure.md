Before I figured out the ideal eating habits for my body, I experienced heartburn all the time. I would take pharmaceutical drugs to ease the pain. Then I learned about all the nasty side effects of the drugs, so I stopped taking them and learned to heal heartburn with healthy eating habits.

Now I only get heartburn when I do certain things like drinking too much wine or coffee. In those cases, I have found two solutions, a food and a drink, that completely stop my heartburn every time. It's like magic! Except, it's not. It's just good food.

Usually, I can stop my heartburn with just one of them, but together they have never failed me, and I've been using them for several years now.

The best thing is, they're both *DELICIOUS*!

They are **cooked oatmeal**  and **kombucha**.

I must warn you, eat the oatmeal first. Drinking kombucha on an empty stomach can make heartburn worse. However, having it along with oatmeal seems to give the oatmeal's medicinal qualities a boost.

I have no idea why oatmeal and kombucha work so well, but here are some guesses:
- Kombucha is acidic. It primarily contains two types of acid: acetic acid and gluconic acid. I suspect that one or both of those types of acid are similar to the acid that our bodies produce, and being similar, trigger the esophageal sphincter to close up tight. That closing prevents any further acid from seeping into the esophagus. Acid seeping into the esophagus causes heartburn, so preventing that makes a big impact.
- Another possible explanation for kombucha's efficacy is that acid coagulates certain liquids. Since kombucha is acidic, I wonder if it coagulates the liquids in the stomach so that they become thick instead of thin. Thicker liquids would have more difficulty seeping into the esophagus.
- It is also possible that kombucha, which has miniscule amounts of alcohol, inhibits the functioning of the immune system, which then stops the immune system from attacking the gut in some way.
- Oatmeal is very absorbative. I suspect that it fills the stomach, absorbs much of the liquid and/or acid in the stomach, and thus prevents additional seepage into the esophagus.

Those are my guesses. Oatmeal and kombucha are amazing for curing heartburn. I don't know how they work, exactly, but I am glad they work so well.
