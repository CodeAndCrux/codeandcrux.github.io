I created a compiler/interpreter for the Forth programming language. I did this using the Swift programming language. Yes, Swift is a high-level language and Forth is a low-level language, so it really makes no sense whatsoever to implement Forth in Swift. But I learned a lot and had to think really hard. This is probably my most fun and most challenging programming project to date.

I call it **cruxForth**.
