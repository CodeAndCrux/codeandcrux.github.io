he spent his life in his lab<br>
searching for a way<br>
to live forever<br>

now on his deathbed<br>
he wishes he had accepted fate<br>
and lived when he had the chance<br>

Before clocks, life was not measured so much in hours or minutes, and even days and years were less important.

Instead, life was measured in moments and seasons. Crops were planted not on a certain date, but when the oak tree's leaves were the size of a squirrel's foot.

We have many reasons to be grateful for the invention of clocks, but when you’re on your death bed, would you rather count the number of minutes you lived or remember the moments?

Think about your life so far in terms of time. It doesn’t seem very long does it? It goes by in a flash. But think about all the moments, the memories, and you have some substance.
