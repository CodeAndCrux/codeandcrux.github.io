Some time ago a famine struck the land.<br>
A hunger, mighty as a tidal wave,<br>
swept away the wits of every man.

Even the richest man became a slave<br>
to appetites of animals, of swine!<br>
It cast a many men into their grave.

But one single man it could not misalign.<br>
He starved himself so they could eat instead.<br>
And so they cooked him - limbs and heart and spine.

Each man shed tears and praised and bowed his head.<br>
Then one bit off a piece of arm and said,<br>
"This man, he tastes like wine and bread."
