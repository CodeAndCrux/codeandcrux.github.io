Some time ago a famine struck the land.
A hunger, mighty as a tidal wave,
swept away the wits of every man.

Even the richest man became a slave
to appetites of animals, of swine!
It cast a many men into their grave.

But one single man it could not misalign.
He starved himself so they could eat instead.
And so they cooked him - limbs and heart and spine.

Each man shed tears and praised and bowed his head.
Then one bit off a piece of arm and said,
"This man, he tastes like wine and bread."
