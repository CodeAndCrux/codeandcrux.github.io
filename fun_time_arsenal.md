I started compiling The Fun Time Arsenal in 2014. The idea was to document all of the fun little tricks, games, jokes, and riddles that I had encountered. I wanted always to remember the simple things that made social life fun.

I worked on The Fun Time Arsenal for about four years. Then I forgot about it.

The 2020 pandemic was a wake up call for me. It caused me to take a deep look at my life. I realized that nothing is more important to me, nothing even comes close, than relationships. I also realized I was doing a terrible job at the thing that was most important to me. Unfortunately, I had no idea how to fix things.

In 2021, I met a woman on a dating app. We went on three dates. I was head-over-heels for this girl. She was still in love with her ex. It sucked, but failing with her lit a fire inside me. I wanted, more than ever, to find my sole (spelled that way intentionally) mate.

Dating that girl showed me that I have courage. She made me nervous because she was so beautiful. I was so nervous on those dates that I lost my appetite for days beforehand. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't focus at work. Yet I got through each date without making (too much) of a fool of myself. I did far better than I thought I could. At the same time, I knew my anxiety played a part in her losing attraction to me.

I needed more courage, so I did more things that terrified me. I joined Toastmasters. I took a rock climbing class. I volunteered at a church group. I started conversing with strangers.

I grew tremendously, yet remained single.

In early 2022, as I went on dates, hung out with new friends, and talked with women, I realized I no longer had trouble with courage, but I had a new problem. I wasn't having fun. I was so hellbent on being attractive and virtuous that I forgot about fun. That was when I found my way back to The Fun Time Arsenal.

It did exactly what I intended it to do when I first created it in 2014. It helped me remember how much fun can be had while waiting for food to cook at a restaurant, talking on the phone, or riding in a car. It, along with the many wonderful friends I have met through various social groups I have joined, reminded me that there are far greater things to do than staying at home, watching YouTube or reading or writing. It reminded me that there is something better than building a successful business, being famous, and having lots of followers.

Spending time with friends and family is the best way to spend time. The Fun Time Arsenal is a compilation of tools that can bring us back to our roots as beings that thrive when we are enjoying our time together.

# Tricks

### Popped Eyeball
Many restaurants, especially diners, leave those little one-inch-tall coffee creamer cups on the table.

When the person you're eating with isn't looking, grab one of those creamer cups. Form a fist around it. If you are holding the cup with your left hand, the paper lid part of the cup should face to the right. If you are holding the cup with your right hand, the lid should face the left.

With the hand that isn't holding the creamer, pick up a fork.

Pretend your eye is bothering you. Hold your hand, with the creamer cup, close to your eye. Pretend to scratch your eye with the fork. The more you act like you are in pain or discomfort, the easier this will be to pull off.

After poking around with the fork for a bit, puncture the creamer cup's lid. If you do it right, it will look like you poked your eye and white eyeball juices gushed out.

### Which Hand, Coin Trick
You can make it look like you grabbed a coin with one hand, but really it is in the other.

Hold a coin with the thumb and index finger of the hand you don't write with. Your palm should face up.

With your other hand shaped like a claw about to grab something, slide your thumb underneath the coin, between your thumb and index finger. It should look like you are about to grab the coin with the hand that is not currently holding it.

As you slide your thumb under the coin, drop the coin into the palm of the same hand that was holding it. As soon as the coin drops into your palm, close both of your fists and hold them out toward another person. Ask them to guess which hand the coin is in.

If you do it right, it will look like you grabbed the coin with your writing hand, but really you just dropped it into the palm of the hand it was already in. If the person was watching, they will guess the wrong hand.
